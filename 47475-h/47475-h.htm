<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p class="pc double"><span class="smcap">The</span> plan of narrative adopted in the ensuing
pages, is recommended by both the sanction and the
example of very learned antiquity; since, without
referring to the numerous classical volumes, which
have been written upon the same principle, two of
the most ancient and esteemed works on English
Jurisprudence have honoured it with their selection.
Of the accuracy of the historical events here recorded,
the authorities so explicitly cited are the
most ample proofs; and, that they might be the
more generally interesting, whatever may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
their original language, the whole are now given in
English: so that an argument should lose none of
its effect from its too erudite obscurity, nor an
illustration any of its amusement by requiring to
be translated.</p>

<p class="double">The collection and arrangement of these materials
have been a labour so unexpectedly toilsome
and extended, as, it is hoped, fully to excuse every
delay in the work’s appearance; and, but for the
valuable aid of those numerous friends who have so
kindly assisted its progress, it must have still been
incomplete. Of these, the first and the most fervent
has been <span class="smcap">John Garratt, Esq.</span>, who, by a singularly
happy coincidence, was at once the founder
of the New London Bridge, as Lord Mayor, and
a native, and Alderman, of the Ward containing
the Old one. Of other benefactors to these sheets,
the names of <span class="smcap">Henry Smedley, Esq.</span>; <span class="smcap">H. P.
Standley, Esq.</span>; <span class="smcap">Henry Woodthorpe, Esq.</span>,
Town Clerk; <span class="smcap">Mr. Joseph York Hatton</span>; <span class="smcap">Mr.
John Thomas Smith</span>, of the British Museum;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Mr. William Upcott</span>, of the London Institution;
and <span class="smcap">Mr. William Knight</span>, of the New
Bridge Works; will sufficiently evince the importance
of their communications; to whom, as well
as to the many other friends, whose kindnesses I
am forbidden to enumerate, I thus offer my sincerest
acknowledgments. The Historians of the
Metropolis have hitherto passed over the subject of
this work far too slightingly: it will be my most
ample praise to have endeavoured to supply that
deficiency, by these</p>

<li><a href="#Historical">Historical Title-page</a>, displaying a rich Gothic edifice, surrounded by
the Effigies, Armorial Ensigns, &amp;c. of the most eminent persons connected
with the history of London Bridge. The two upper figures represent Richard,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal Hugo di Petraleone, who subscribed
so liberally to its original foundation, (see <a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>,) and the two lower
ones, Kings John and Edward I., commemorative of the Bridge having been
finished in the reign of the former, and of the several grants made to it by
the latter. In the upper centre is suspended a banner, with the present
Royal Arms of England, alluding to the foundation of the New London
Bridge in the reign of George IV.; and beneath it, a representation in
tapestry, of the triumphal entry of Henry V. across the ancient Bridge,
in 1415, after the victory of Agincourt, described on <a href="#Page_220">pages 220-229</a>: at the
sides of which are groups of banners, &amp;c., commemorative of some of the
principal persons engaged in the battle. Below, are the Armorial Ensigns of
King Henry II., the Priory of St. Mary Overies, the ancient device of Southwark,
and the Monograms of Peter of Colechurch, and Isenbert of Xainctes;
the benefactors and Architects of the First Stone Bridge at London. Beneath
these is a monumental effigy of Peter of Colechurch; under which appear
the ancient and modern Arms of the City of London, see <a href="#Page_177">page 177</a>; those of
Robert Serle, Mercer, and Custos of London in 1214, the principal citizen to
whom the finishing of the Bridge was entrusted, see <a href="#Page_73">page 73</a>; those of Henry
Walleis, Lord Mayor in 1282, and an eminent benefactor to London Bridge,
see <a href="#Page_131">pages 131</a>, <a href="#Page_132">132</a>; and in the centre, the shield of John Garratt, Esq.,
Alderman of the Ward of Bridge-Within, and Lord Mayor in 1824-25, who
laid the First Stone of the New Edifice: see <a href="#Page_635">pages 635-660</a>.&mdash;Designed and

<p class="pc drop-cap"><span class="upper-case smcap">So</span> numerous are the alterations
and modernisms in almost every
street of this huge metropolis,
that I verily believe, the conservators
of our goodly city are
trying the strength of a London
Antiquary’s heart; and, by their
continual spoliations, endeavouring
to ascertain whether it be really made “of penetrable
stuff.” For my own part, if they continue thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
improving, I must even give up the ghost; since, in a
little time, there will not be a spot left, where any feature
of age will carry back my remembrance to its
ancient original. What with pullings-down, and
buildings-up; the turning of land into canals, and covering
over old water-ways with new paved streets;
erecting pert plaister fronts to some venerable old
edifices, and utterly abolishing others from off the face
of the earth; London but too truly resembles the celebrated
keepsake-knife of the sailor, which, for its
better preservation, had been twice re-bladed, and
was once treated with a new handle. One year carried
with it that grand fragment of our city’s wall,
which so long girdled-in Moorfields; while another
bedevilled the ancient gate of St. John’s Priory with
Heraldry, which Belzebub himself could not blazon,
and left but one of the original hinges to its antique
pier. Nay, there are reports, too, that even Derby
House, the fair old College of Heralds,&mdash;where my
youth was taught “the blasynge of Cote Armures,”
under two of the wisest officers that ever wore a tabard,&mdash;that
even <em>that</em> unassuming quadrangle is to be
forthwith levelled with the dust, and thus for ever
blotted from the map of London! Alas for the day!
Moorgate is not, and Aldgate is not! Aldersgate is
but the shadow of a name, and Newgate lives only
as the title of a prison-house! In the absence, then, of
many an antique building which I yet remember, I
have little else to supply the vacuum in my heart, but
to wander around the ruins of those few which still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
exist:&mdash;to gaze on the rich transomed bay-windows
that even yet light the apartments of Sir Paul Pindar’s
now degraded dwelling; to look with regret
upon the prostituted Halls of Crosby House; or to
roam over to the Bankside, and contemplate the fast-perishing
fragments of Winchester’s once proud Episcopal
Palace.</p></div>

<p>It was but recently, in my return from visiting the
spot last mentioned, that I betook me to a Tavern
where I was erst wont to indulge in another old-fashioned
luxury,&mdash;which has also been taken away
from me,&mdash;that of quaffing genuine wine, drawn
reaming from the butt in splendid silver jugs, in the
merry old <span class="smcap">Shades</span> by <span class="smcap">London Bridge</span>. I loved this
custom, because it was one of the very few fragments
of an ancient Citizen’s conviviality, which have descended
to us: a worthy old friend and relative, many
a long year since, first introduced me to the goodly
practice, and though I originally liked it merely for
<em>his</em> sake, yet I very soon learned to admire it for its
own. It was a most lovely moonlight night, and I
placed myself in one of the window boxes, whence I
could see the fastly-ebbing tide glittering with silvery
flashes; whilst the broad radiance of the planet, cast
upon the pale stone colour of the Bridge, strikingly
contrasted with the gas star-like sparks which shone
from the lamps above it. “Alas!” murmured I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> “pass
but another twenty years, and even thou, stately
old London Bridge!&mdash;even <em>thou</em> shalt live only in
memory, and the draughts which are now made of
thine image. In modern eyes, indeed, these may seem
of little value, but unto Antiquaries, even the rudest
resemblance of that which is not, is worth the gold of
Ind; and Oh! that we possessed some fair limning of
thine early forms; or Oh! for some faithful old Chronicler,
who knew thee in all thine ancient pride and
splendour, to tell us the interesting story of thy foundation,
thine adventures, and thy fate!”</p>

<p>It was at this part of my reverie, that the Waiter at
the Shades touched my elbow to inform me, that a
stout old gentleman, who called himself <span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby
Postern</span>, had sent his compliments, and desired the
pleasure of my society in the drinking of a hot sack-posset.
“My services and thanks,” said I, “wait upon
the ancient, I shall be proud of his company: but for
sack-posset, where, in the name of Dame Woolley,
that all-accomplished cook, hath he learned how to&mdash;&mdash;?
but he comes.”</p>

<p>My visitor, as he entered, did not appear any thing
very remarkable; he looked simply a shrewd, hale,
short old gentleman, of stiff formal manners, wrapped
in a dark-coloured cloak, and bearing in his hand a
covered tankard, which he set upon the table betwixt
us; after which, making a very low bow, he took his
seat opposite to me, and at once opened the conversation.</p>

<p>“Your fame,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> “<span class="smcap">Mr. Geoffrey Barbican</span>,
as a London Antiquary, is not unknown to me; and
I have sometimes pleased myself with the thought,
that you must be even a distant relation of my own,
since tradition says, that the <em>Barbicans</em> and the <em>Posterns</em>
originally received their names from having been
gate-keepers in various parts of this fair city: but of
that I will not positively speak. Howbeit, I am right
glad of this fellowship, because I have some communications
and reflections which I would fain make to
you, touching the earlier days of that Bridge, under
which the tide is now so rapidly running.”</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Postern,” said I, in rapture, “nothing
could delight me more than an Antiquary’s stories
of that famous edifice; but moralising I abominate,
since I can do that for myself, even to admiration; so,
my good friend Mr. Barnaby, as much description,
and as many rich old sketches, as you please, but no
reflections, my kinsman, no reflections.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned my visitor, “I will do my best
to entertain you; but you very well know, that we
old fellows, who have seen generations rise and decay,
are apt to make prosing remarks:&mdash;However, we’ll
start fairly, and taste of my tankard before we set
out: trust me, it’s filled with that same beverage,
which Sir John Falstaff used to drink o’nights in
East Cheap; for the recip&eacute; for brewing it was found,
written in a very ancient hand upon a piece of vellum,
when the Boar’s Head was pulled down many a long
year ago. Drink, then, worthy Mr. Barbican; drink,
good Sir;&mdash;you’ll find it excellent beverage, and I’ll
pledge you in kind.”</p>

<p>Upon this invitation, I drank of my visitor’s tankard;
and believe me, reader, I never yet tasted any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
thing half so delicious; for it fully equalled the
eulogium which Shakspeare’s jovial knight pronounces
upon it in the Second part of “<em>King Henry the
Fourth</em>,” Act iv. sc. iii.; where the merry Cavalier
of Eastcheap tells us, that “a good Sherris sack
hath a two-fold operation in it: it ascends me into the
brain, dries me there all the foolish, and dull, and
crudy vapours which environ it: makes it apprehensive,
quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable
shapes; which, delivered o’er to the voice, (the
tongue,) which is the birth, becomes excellent wit.
The second property of your excellent Sherris is,&mdash;the
warming of the blood; which, before cold and settled,
left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of
pusillanimity and cowardice: but the Sherris warms
it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts
extreme. It illumineth the face; which, as a beacon,
gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
man, to arm; and then, the vital commoners, and
inland petty spirits, muster me all to their Captain,
the heart; who, great, and puffed up with this retinue,
doth any deed of courage; and this valour comes of
Sherris: so that skill in the weapon is nothing,
without Sack: for that sets it a-work: and learning,
a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till Sack commences
it, and sets it in act and use.&mdash;If I had a thousand
sons, the first human principle I would teach
them, should be,&mdash;to forswear thin potations, and
addict themselves to Sack!”</p>

<p>Truly, indeed, I felt all those effects in myself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
whilst my visitor appeared to be so inspired by it,
that, as if all the valuable lore relating to London
Bridge had been locked up until this moment, he
opened to me such a treasure of information concerning
it, that, I verily believe, he left nothing connected
with the subject untouched. He quoted books
and authors with a facility, to which I have known no
parallel; and, what is quite as extraordinary, the same
magical philtre enabled me as faithfully to retain them.
Indeed, the posset and his discourse seemed to enliven
all my faculties in such a manner, that the very scenes
of which my companion spake, appeared to rise before
my eyes as he described them. When Mr. Postern
had pledged me, therefore, by drinking my health, in
a very formal manner, he thus commenced his discourse.</p>

<p>“You very well know, my good Mr. Barbican, that
Gulielmus Stephanides, or, as the vulgar call him,
William Fitz-Stephen, who was the friend and secretary
of Thomas &agrave; Becket, a native of London, and who died
about 1191, in his invaluable tract ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Descriptio Nobilissim&aelig;
Civitatis Londoni&aelig;</cite>,’ folio 26, tells us that to the
North of London, there existed, in his days, the large
remains of that immense forest which once covered the
very banks of this brave river. ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proxime patet ingens
foresta</i>,’ &amp;c. begins the passage; and pray observe
that I quote from the best edition with a commentary
by that excellent Antiquary Dr. Samuel Pegge, published
in London, in the year 1772, in quarto. Ever,
Mr. Barbican, while you live, ever quote from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio optima</i> of every author whom you cite; for, next
to a knowledge of books themselves, is an acquaintance
with the best editions. But to return, Sir; in those
woody groves of yew, which the old citizens wisely encouraged
for the making of their bows, were then hunted
the stag, the buck, and the doe; and the great Northern
road, which now echoes the tuneful Kent bugle of
mail-coach-guards, was then an extensive wilderness,
resounding with the shrill horns of the Saxon Chiefs, as
they waked up the deer from his lair of vert and brushwood.
The very paths, too, that now behold the herds of
oxen and swine driven town-ward to support London’s
hungry thousands, then echoed with the bellowing of savage
bulls, and the harsh grunting of many a stout wild
boar. But, as you have observed, <em>I</em> am to describe
scenes, and <em>you</em> are to moralise upon their changes,
so we’ll hasten down again to the water-side, only observing,
that the site of the ancient British London
is yet certainly marked out to you, by the old rhyming
stone in Pannier Alley, by St. Paul’s, which saith:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘WHEN Y<sup>V</sup> HAVE SOVGHT<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“Now, Julius C&aelig;sar tells you in his Commentaries
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Bello Gallico</cite>,’ <em>lib.</em> v. <em>cap.</em> xxi. that ‘a British town
was nothing more than a thick wood, fortified with a
ditch and rampart, to serve as a place of retreat against
the incursions of their enemies.’ Here, then, stood our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
good old city, upon the best ’vantage ground of the
Forest of Middlesex; the small hive-shaped dwellings
of the Britons, formed of bark, or boughs, or reeds
from the rushy sides of these broad waters, being interspersed
between the trees; whilst their little mountain
metropolis, the ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum reperit egregi&egrave; natur&acirc;,
atque opere munitum</i>,’ a place which appeared extremely
strong, both by art and nature,&mdash;as the same matchless
classic called those primitive defences,&mdash;was guarded
on the North by a dark wood, that might have daunted
even the Roman Cohorts; and to the South, where there
was no wilderness, morasses, covered with fat weeds,
and divided by such streams as the Wall-brook, the
Shareburn, the Fleta, and others of less note, stretched
downward to the Thames. As C&aelig;sar and his Legions
marched straight from the coast, worthy old
Bagford was certainly in the right, when, in a letter to
his brother-antiquary Hearne, he said, that the Roman
invader came along the rich marshy ground now supporting
Kent Street,&mdash;in truth very unlike the road
of a splendid conqueror,&mdash;and, entering the Thames
as the tide was just turning, his army made a wide
angle, and was driven on shore by the current close
to yonder Cement Wharf, at Dowgate Dock. This
you find prefixed to Tom Hearne’s edition of Leland’s
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collectanea de Rebus Britannicis</cite>,’ London, 1774, 8vo.,
volume i. pp. lviii. lix.: and many an honest man, since ‘the
hook-nosed fellow of Rome,’ before a bridge carried
him over the waters dry-shod, has tried the same route,
in preference to going up to the Mill-ford, in the Strand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or York-ford which lay still higher. In good time,
however, the Romans, to commemorate their own
successful landing there, built a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trajectus</i>, or Ferry, to
convey passengers to their famous military road which
led to Dover. But history is not wholly without the
mention of a Bridge over the Thames near London,
even still earlier than this period; for, when Dion
Cassius is recording the invasion of Britain by the
Emperor Claudius I., A. D. 44, he says,&mdash;‘The Britons
having betaken themselves to the River Thames, where
it discharges itself into the Sea, easily passed over it,
being perfectly acquainted with its depths and shallows:
while the Romans, pursuing them, were thereby
brought into great danger. The Gauls, however,
again setting sail, and <em>some of them having passed
over by the Bridge, higher up the River</em>, they set upon
the Britons on all sides with great slaughter; until,
rashly pursuing those that escaped, many of them perished
in the bogs and marshes.’ This passage, which
it must be owned, however, is not very satisfactory,
is to be found in the best edition of the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Histori&aelig;
Roman&aelig;</cite>,’ by Fabricius and Reimar, Hamburgh,
1750-52, folio, volume ii. page 958; in the 60th
Book and 20th Section. The Greek text begins,
‘<span lang="el" title="Anach&ocirc;r&ecirc;sant&ocirc;n
d’ enteuthen t&ocirc;n Brettan&ocirc;n epi ton Tamesan potamon">Ἀναχωρησάντων
δ’ ἐντεῦθεν τῶν Βρεττανῶν ἐπὶ τὸν Ταμέσαν ποταμὸν</span>,’ &amp;c.; and the Latin&mdash;‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inde se Britanni ad fluvium
Tamesin</i>.’ I have only to remind you that Dion
Cassius flourished about A. D. 230. Before we finally
quit Roman London, however, I must make one more
historical remark. The inscription on the monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which I quoted from Pannier Alley, is dated August
the 27th, 1688; and if even at <em>that period</em>,&mdash;through
all the mutations of the soil, and more than sixteen centuries
after the Roman Invasion,&mdash;the ground still retained
its original altitude, it yet further proves on
how admirable a site our ancient London was originally
erected:&mdash;well worthy, indeed, to be the metropolis
of the world. This also is remarked by honest
Bagford, in his work already cited, where, at page
lxxii., he says,&mdash;‘For many of our ancient kings and
nobility took delight in the situation of the old
Roman buildings, which were always very fine and
pleasant, the Romans being very circumspect in regard
to their settlements, having always an eye to some
river, spring, wood, &amp;c. for the convenience of life,
particularly an wholesome air. And this no doubt
occasioned the old Monks, Knights Templars, and,
after them, the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, as
also the Friars, to settle in most of the Roman
buildings, as well private as public, which thing, if
duly considered, will be found to be a main reason
why we have so few remains of them.’</p>

<p>“As I have always considered that the Romans had
no more to do with Britain, than Joe the waiter here
would have in a Conclave of Cardinals, I will not
trouble you with any sketch of the dress or manners
of the ferryman and his customers, during their government.
Indeed, as a native of London, I always
lament over it as the time of our captivity; and so I
shall hasten on to the tenth century, when our Runic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Ancestors from Gothland were settled in Britain;&mdash;when
courage was the chiefest virtue, and the rudest
hospitality&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have pity upon me, my excellent Mr. Postern,”
interrupted I, “for I am naturally impatient at reflections;
if you love me, then, give me scenery without
meditations, and history without a moral.”</p>

<p>“Truly, Sir,” said he, “I was oblivious, for I’d got
upon a favourite topic of mine, the worth of our
Saxon fore-fathers; but we’ll cut them off short by
another draught of the sack-posset, and take up
again with the establishment of a ferry by one Master
Audery, in the year nine hundred and ninety&mdash;&mdash;Ah!
see now, my memory has left me for the precise year,
but nevertheless, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, my service to
you.” When he had passed me the tankard, after
what I considered a very reasonable draught, Mr.
Postern thus continued.</p>

<p>“I hold it right, my friend, to mix these convivialia
with our antiquarian discussions, because I know that
they are not only ancient, but in a manner peculiar to
this part of the water-side; for we find Stephanides,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stephanus ab Stephano</i>, as I may jocularly call
him, whom I before quoted, saying at folio 32,
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pr&aelig;terea est in Londonia super ripam fluminis</i>,’ &amp;c. but
we’ll give the quotation in plain English. ‘And
moreover, on the banks of the river, besides the wine
sold in ships’&mdash;that is to say, foreign wines of Anjou,
Auxere, and Gascoigne, though even then we had
some Saxon and Rhenish wines well worth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
drinking,&mdash;‘besides the wines sold in ships and vaults,
there is a public eating-house, or cook’s shop. Here,
according to the season, you may find victuals of all
kinds, roasted, baked, fried, or boiled. Fish, large
and small, with coarse viands for the poorer sort, and
more delicate ones for the rich, such as venison, fowls,
and small birds. In case a friend should arrive at a
Citizen’s house, much wearied with his journey, and
chuses not to wait, an-hungered as he is, for the buying
and cooking of meat,</p>

<p class="blockquot">The water’s served, the bread’s in baskets brought,</p>
<p class="blockquot right"><cite>Virg. &AElig;n.</cite> i. 705.</p>


<p class="pc">and recourse is immediately had to the bank above-mentioned,
where every thing desirable is instantly
procured. No number so great, of knights or strangers,
can either enter the city at any hour of day or
night, or leave it, but all may be supplied with provisions,
so that those have no occasion to fast too long,
nor these to depart the city without their dinner.
To this place, if they be so disposed, they resort, and
there they regale themselves, every man according to
his abilities. Those who have a mind to indulge,
need not to hanker after sturgeon, nor a guinea-fowl,
nor a gelinote de bois,’&mdash;which some call red-game,
and others a godwit&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>‘for there are delicacies enough
to gratify their palates. It is a public eating-house,
and is both highly convenient and useful to the city,
and is a clear proof of its civilization.’</p>

<p>“Thus speaks Fitz-Stephen of the time of Henry
II. between the years 1170 and 1182; and if you look
but two centuries later, you shall find that John Holland,
Duke of Exeter, held his Inn here at Cold
Harbour, and gave to his half-brother, King Richard
the Second, a sumptuous dinner, in 1397. Then too,
when this spot became the property of the merry
Henry Plantagenet, Prince of Wales, by the gift of
Henry the Fourth, the same King filled his cellars
with ‘twenty casks and one pipe of red wine of Gascoigne,
free of duty.’ This you have on the authority
of John Stow, on the one part, in his ‘<cite>Survey of London</cite>,’
the best edition by John Strype, &amp;c. London, 1754,
folio, volume i. page 523; and of Master Thomas
Pennant, on the other, in his ‘<cite>Account of London</cite>,’
2nd edition, London, 1791, 4to, page 330.”</p>

<div>
<p>“Aye, Master Postern,” said I, “and that same Cold
Harbour is not the less dear to me, forasmuch as Stow
noteth, in the very place which you have just now
cited, that Richard the Third gave the Messuage, and
all its appurtenances, to John Wrythe, Garter Principal
King of Arms, and the rest of the Royal Heralds
and Pursuivants, in 1485.”&mdash;“True, Mr. Geoffrey,
true,” answered my visitor; “and you may remember
that here also, in these very Shades, did King Charles
the merry, regale incognito; and here, too, came Addison
and his galaxy of wits to finish a social evening.
Then, but a little above to the North, was the famous
market of East Cheap; of which our own Stow speaks
in his book before cited, page 503, quoting the very
rare ballad of ‘<cite>London Lickpenny</cite>,’ composed by Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
John Lydgate, of which a copy in the old chronicler’s

<p>“Lydgate, you know, died in the year 1440, at the
age of sixty. In the present day, indeed, we have only
the indications of this festivity in the names of the
ways leading down to, or not far from, the river; as,
Pudding Lane, Fish Street Hill, the Vine-tree, or
Vintry, Bread-street,&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold! hold! my dear Mr. Barnaby,” interrupted
I, “what on earth has all this long muster-roll of
gluttony to do with London Bridge? You are, as it
were, endeavouring to prove, that yonder is the moon
lighting the waters; for certes, it is a self-evident truth,
that the citizens of London have from time immemorial
been mighty trencher-men; nay, if I remember
me rightly, your own favourite Stephanides says,
‘The only plagues of London are, immoderate drinking
of idle fellows, and often fires:’ so <em>that</em> we’ll take for
granted, and get on to the Bridge.”</p>

<p>“You are in the right,” answered Mr. Postern;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
“the passage begins ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sol&aelig; pestes Londoni&aelig;</i>,’ &amp;c. at
folio 42, and truly I wished but to shew you how
proper a place these Shades are to be convivial in;
but now we will but just touch upon the Saxon Ferry
and Wooden Bridge, and then come at once to the
first stone one, founded by the excellent Peter of Colechurch,
in the year 1176. I would you could but
have seen the curious boat in which, for many years,
Audery the Ship-wight, as the Saxons called him,
rowed his fare over those restless waters. It was in
form very much like a crescent laid upon its back,
only the sharp horns turned over into a kind of scroll;
and when it was launched, if the passengers did not
trim the barque truly, there was some little danger of
its tilting over, for it was only the very centre of the
keel that touched the water. But our shipman had
also another wherry, for extra passengers, and that
had the appearance of a blanket gathered up at each
end, whilst those within looked as if they were about
to be tossed in it. His oars were in the shape of shovels,
or an ace of spades stuck on the end of a yard
measure; though one of them rather seemed as if he
were rowing with an arrow, having the barb broken
off, and the flight held downwards. It is nearly
certain, that at this period there was no barrier across
the Thames; for you may remember how the ‘<cite>Saxon
Chronicle</cite>,’ sub anno 993, tells you that the Dane
Olaf, Anlaf, or Unlaf, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mid thrym et hundnigentigon
scipum to Stane</i>,’&mdash;which is to say, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> ‘he sailed
with three hundred and ninety ships to Staines,
which he plundered without, and thence went to
Sandwich.’</p>

<p>“Before I leave speaking of this King Olaf, however,
I wish you to observe the paction which he made
with the English King Ethelred, for we shall find him
hereafter closely connected with the history of London
Bridge. The same authority, and under the
same year and page, tells you that, after gaining the
battle of Maldon, and the death of Alderman Britnoth,
peace was made with Anlaf, ‘and the King received
him at Episcopal hands, by the advice of Siric, Bishop
of Canterbury, and Elfeah of Winchester.’ On page 171,
in the year 994, you also find this peace more solemnly
confirmed in the following passage. ‘Then sent the
King after King Anlaf, Bishop Elfeah, and Alderman
Ethelwerd, and hostages being left with the ships,
they led Anlaf with great pomp to the King, at Andover.
And King Ethelred received him at Episcopal
hands, and honoured him with royal presents.
In return Anlaf promised, as he also performed,
that he never again would come in a hostile
manner to England.’ I quote, as usual, from the best
edition of this invaluable record by Professor Ingram,
London, 1823, 4to. It is generally believed, however,
that the year following Anlaf’s invasion, namely 994,
there was built a low Wooden Bridge, which crossed
the Thames at St. Botolph’s Wharf yonder, where the
French passage vessels are now lying; and a rude
thing enough it was, I’ll warrant; built of thick rough-hewn
timber planks, placed upon piles, with moveable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
platforms to allow the Saxon vessels to pass
through it Westward. A Bridge of any kind is not
so small a concern but what one might suppose you
could avoid running against it, and yet William of
Malmesbury, the Benedictine Monk, who lived in the
reign of King Stephen, and died in 1142, says, that, in
994, King Sweyn of Denmark, the Invader, ran foul
of it with his Fleet. This you find mentioned in his
book, ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Gestis Regum Anglorum</cite>,’ the best edition,
London, 1596, folio:&mdash;though, by the way, the preferable
one is called the Frankfurt reprint of 1601, as
it contains all the errata of the London text, and
adds a good many more of its own; for I am much of
the mind of Bishop Nicolson, and Sir Henry Spelman,
who observe that the Germans committed abundance
of faults with the English words. In this record, which
is contained in Sir Henry Savile’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rerum Anglicarum
Scriptores Post Bedam</cite>,’ of the foregoing date and
size, at folio 38<sup>b</sup>, is the passage beginning ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mox ad
Australes regiones</i>,’ <em>&amp;c.</em> of which this is the purport.</p>

<p>“‘Some time after, the Southern parts, with the inhabitants
of Oxford and Winchester, were brought to
honour his’&mdash;that is to say King Sweyn’s&mdash;‘laws: the
Citizens of London alone, with their lawful King’&mdash;Ethelred
the Second&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>‘betook themselves within
the walls, having securely closed the gates. Against
their ferocious assailants, the Danes, they were supported
by their virtue, and the hope of glory. The
Citizens rushed forward even to death for their liberty;
for none could think himself secure of the
future if the King were deserted, in whose life he
committed his own: so that although the conflict was
valiant on both sides, yet the Citizens had the victory
from the justness of their cause; every one endeavouring
to shew, throughout this great work, how
sweet he estimated those pains which he bore for him.
The enemy was partly overthrown; and part was
destroyed in the River Thames, over which, in their
precipitation and fury, they never looked for the
Bridge.’</p>

<p>“I know very well that the truth of this circumstance
is much questioned by Master Maitland, at
page 43 of his ‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ continued by the
Rev. John Entick, London, 1772, folio, volume i.;
wherein he denies that any historian mentions a
Bridge at London, in the incursion of Anlaf or Sweyn;
and asserts that the loss of the army of the latter was
occasioned ‘by his attempting to pass the River,
without enquiring after Ford, or Bridge.’ He affirms
too, that Stow mistakes the account given by William
of Malmesbury; and that the Monk himself distorts
his original authority in saying that the invaders had
not a regard to the Bridge. Now, if, as the margin of
Maitland’s History states, the Saxon Chronicle were
<em>that</em> authority, the Library-keeper of Malmesbury
had no greater right to speak as Maitland does, than
he had for using those words which I have already
translated,&mdash;‘part were destroyed in the River
Thames, over which, in their precipitation and fury,
they never looked for the Bridge:’ for the words of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Saxon Chronicle, at page 170, are, in reality,&mdash;‘And
they closely besieged the City and would fain have
set it on fire, but they sustained more harm and evil
than they ever supposed that the Citizens could inflict
on them. The Holy Mother of God’&mdash;for the Invasion
took place on her Nativity, September the 8th,&mdash;‘on
that day considered the Citizens, and ridded them
of their enemies.’ Here then is no word of a Bridge,
nor, indeed, does any Historian record the event as
William of Malmesbury does. <em>Lambarde</em>&mdash;whom I
shall quote anon,&mdash;when he relates it, cites the ‘<cite>Chronicle
of Peterborough</cite>,’ and the ‘<cite>Annals of Margan</cite>,’ but
neither of them have the word Bridge upon their
pages. He, most probably, took this circumstance
from Marianus Scotus, a Monk of Mentz, in Germany,
who wrote an extensive History of England
and Europe ending in 1083, but, of this, only the
German part has been printed, although it was amazingly
popular in manuscript.</p>

<p>“We have, however, an earlier description of
London Bridge in a state of warlike splendour, than
is commonly imagined, or at least referred to, by most
Antiquaries; and that too from a source of no inconsiderable
authority: for the learned old Icelander
Snorro Sturlesonius, who wrote in the 13th century,
and who was assassinated in 1241, on page 90 of
that rather rare work by the Rev. James Johnstone,
entitled ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquitates Celto-Scandic&aelig;</cite>,’ Copenhagen,
1786, quarto, gives the following very interesting particulars
of the Battle of Southwark, which took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in the year 1008, in the unhappy reign of Ethelred
II., surnamed the Unready.</p>

<p>“‘They’&mdash;that is the Danish forces&mdash;‘first came to
shore at London, where their ships were to remain,
and the City was taken by the Danes. Upon the other
side of the River, is situate a great market called
Southwark,’&mdash;Sudurvirke in the original&mdash;‘which
the Danes fortified with many defences; framing, for
instance, a high and broad ditch, having a pile or
rampart within it, formed of wood, stone, and turf,
with a large garrison placed there to strengthen it.
This, the King Ethelred,’&mdash;his name, you know, is
Adalradr in the original,&mdash;‘attacked and forcibly
fought against; but by the resistance of the Danes
it proved but a vain endeavour. There was, at that
time, a Bridge erected over the River between the
City and Southwark, so wide, that if two carriages
met they could pass each other. At the sides of the
Bridge, at those parts which looked upon the River,
were erected Ramparts and Castles that were defended
on the top by penthouse-bulwarks and sheltered turrets,
covering to the breast those who were fighting
in them: the Bridge itself was also sustained by piles
which were fixed in the bed of the River. An attack
therefore being made, the forces occupying the Bridge
fully defended it. King Ethelred being thereby
enraged, yet anxiously desirous of finding out some
means by which he might gain the Bridge, at once
assembled the Chiefs of the army to a conference on
the best method of destroying it. Upon this, King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Olaf engaged,’&mdash;for you will remember he was an
ally of Ethelred,&mdash;‘that if the Chiefs of the army
would support him with their forces, he would make
an attack upon it with his ships. It being ordained
then in council, that the army should be marched
against the Bridge, each one made himself ready for
a simultaneous movement both of the ships and of
the land forces.’</p>

<p>“I must here entreat your patience, Mr. Geoffrey
Barbican, to follow the old Norwegian through the
consequent battle; for although he gives us no more
scenery of London Bridge, yet he furnishes us with a
minute account of its destruction, and of a conflict upon
it, concerning which all our own historians are, in
general, remarkably silent. I say too, with Falstaff,
‘play out the play;’ for I have yet much to say on the
behalf of that King Olaf, who, we shall find, is the
patron protector of yonder Church at the South-East
corner of London Bridge, since he died a Saint and a
Martyr. Snorro Sturleson then, having cleared the
way for the forcing of London Bridge on the behalf of
King Ethelred, thus begins his account of the action,
entitling it, in the Scandinavian tongue, Orrosta, or the
fight. ‘King Olaf, having determined on the construction
of an immense scaffold, to be formed of
wooden poles and osier twigs, set about pulling down
the old houses in the neighbourhood for the use of the
materials. With these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vinea</i>, therefore,’&mdash;as such defences
were anciently termed&mdash;‘he so enveloped his
ships, that the scaffolds extended beyond their sides;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and they were so well supported, as to afford not only
a sufficient space for engaging sword in hand, but
also a base firm enough for the play of his engines, in
case they should be pressed upon from above. The
Fleet, as well as the forces, being now ready, they rowed
towards the Bridge, the tide being adverse; but no
sooner had they reached it, than they were violently
assailed from above with a shower of missiles and
stones, of such immensity that their helmets and shields
were shattered, and the ships themselves very seriously
injured. Many of them, therefore, retired.
But Olaf the King and his Norsemen having rowed
their ships close up to the Bridge, made them fast to
the piles with ropes and cables, with which they
strained them, and the tide seconding their united
efforts, the piles gradually gave way, and were withdrawn
from under the Bridge. At this time, there
was an immense pressure of stones and other weapons,
so that the piles being removed, the whole Bridge
brake down, and involved in it’s fall the ruin of
many. Numbers, however, were left to seek refuge by
flight: some into the City, others into Southwark.
And now it was determined to attack Southwark:
but the Citizens seeing their River Thames occupied
by the enemy’s navies, so as to cut off all intercourse
that way with their interior provinces, were seized
with fear, and having surrendered the City, received
Ethelred as King. In remembrance of this expedition
thus sang Ottar Suarti.’</p>

<p>“And now, Sir, as this is, without any doubt, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
song which was ever made about London Bridge, I
shall give you the Norse Bard’s verses in Macpherson’s
Ossianic measure, as that into which they
most readily translate themselves; premising that the
ensuing are of immeasurably greater authenticity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘And thou hast overthrown their Bridges, Oh
thou Storm of the Sons of Odin! skilful and foremost
in the Battle! For thee was it happily reserved
to possess the land of London’s winding City.
Many were the shields which were grasped sword
in hand to the mighty increase of the conflict; but
by thee were the iron-banded coats of mail broken
and destroyed.’</p></blockquote>

<p>And ‘besides this,’ continues Snorro, ‘he also sang:’</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Thou, thou hast come, Defender of the Earth,
and hast restored into his Kingdom the exiled
Ethelred. By thine aid is he advantaged, and made
strong by thy valour and prowess: Bitterest was
that Battle in which thou didst engage. Now, in
the presence of thy kindred the adjacent lands are
at rest, where Edmund, the relation of the country
and the people, formerly governed.’</p></blockquote>

<p>‘Besides this, these things are thus remembered by
Sigvatus.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘That was truly the sixth fight which the mighty
King fought with the men of England: wherein
King Olaf,&mdash;the Chief himself a Son of Odin, valiantly
attacked the Bridge at London. Bravely
did the swords of the V&ouml;lscs defend it, but through
the trench which the Sea-Kings, the men of Vikes-land,
guarded, they were enabled to come, and the
plain of Southwark was full of his tents.’</p></blockquote>

<p>“Such were the martial feats of King Olafus, upon
the water; and now let us turn to his more pious
and peaceful actions upon the land, that caused the
men of Southwark to found to his honour yonder
fane, which still bears his name and consecrates his
memory. And in so doing, I pray you to observe
that I am not wandering from the subject before us;
for that Church is one of the Southern boundaries of
London Bridge, and, as such, possesses some interest
in its history. The other, on the same side, is the Monastery
of St. Mary Overies, of the which I shall hereafter
discourse; whilst the two Northern ones are St.
Magnus’ Church, and that abode of festivity which
rises above us, Fishmongers’ Hall, of which the story
will be best noticed when we shall have arrived at the
time of the Great Fire. There are within the City
walls and Diocese of London, three Churches dedicated
to the Norwegian King and Martyr, St. Olaf;
and in consequence, Richard Newcourt, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Repertorium
Ecclesiasticum Parochiale Londinense</cite>,’ which I
shall hereafter notice, volume i. page 509, takes occasion to
speak somewhat of his history; collected, most probably,
from Adam of Bremen’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Ecclesiarum
Hamburgensis et Bremensis</cite>.’ He was the Son of
Herald Grenscius, Prince of Westfold, in Norway, and
was celebrated for having expelled the Swedes from
that country, and recovering Gothland. It was after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
these exploits that he came to England, and remained
here as an ally of King Ethelred for three years,
expelling the Danes from the Cities, Towns, and Fortresses,
and ultimately returning home with great spoil.
He was recalled to England by Emma of Normandy,
the surviving Queen of his friend, to assist her against
Knute; but as he found a paction concluded between
that King and the English, he soon withdrew, and
was then created King of Norway by the voice of the
nation. To strengthen his throne, he married the
daughter of the King of Swedeland; but now his
strict adherence to the Christian faith, and his active
zeal for the spread of it, caused him to be molested by
domestic wars, as well as by the Danes abroad: though
these he regarded not, since he piously and valiantly
professed, that he had rather lose his life and Kingdom
than his faith in Christ. Upon this, the men of
Norway complained to Knute, King of Denmark, and
afterwards of England, charging Olaf with altering
their laws and customs, and entreating his assistance;
but the Norwegian hero was supported by a young
soldier named Amandus, King of Swethland, who had
been bred up under Olaf, and taught to fight by him.
He, at first, overthrew the Dane in an engagement;
but Knute, having bribed the adverse fleet, procured
three hundred of his ships to revolt, and then
attacking Olaf, forced him to retreat into his own
country, where his subjects received him as an enemy.
He fled from the disloyal Pagans to Jerislaus, King of
Russia, who was his brother-in-law, and remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with him till the better part of his subjects, in the
commotions of the Kingdom, calling him to resume
his crown, he went at the head of an army; when,
whilst one party hailed his return with joy, the other,
urged by Knute, opposed him by force, and in a disloyal
battle at Stichstadt, to the North of Drontheim,
says Newcourt, page 510, with considerable pathos,
they ‘murthered this holy friend of Christ, this most
innocent King, in Anno 1028,’ but he should have
said 1030. His feast is commemorated on the fourth
of the Kalends of August, that is to say on the 29th
of July; for Grimkele, Bishop of Drontheim, his
capital City, a pious priest whom he had brought from
England to assist him in establishing Christianity in
Norway, commanded that he should be honoured as a
Saint, with the title of Martyr. His body was buried
in Drontheim, and was not only found undecayed in
1098, but even in 1541, when the Lutherans plundered
his shrine of its gold and jewels; for it was esteemed
the greatest treasure in the North. Such
was St. Olave, to whose memory no less than four
Churches in London are dedicated; for, says Newcourt,
he ‘had well deserved, and was well beloved
of our English Nation, as well for his friendship
for assisting them against the Danes, as for his holy
and Christian life, by the erection of many Churches
which to his honourable memory they built and dedicated
to him.’ I notice only one of these, because it
is contiguous to London Bridge, which is called St.
Olave, Southwark. It stands, as you very well know, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Northern side of Tooley Street; and although
many people would think St. Tooley to be somewhat
of a questionable patron for a Church, yet I would
remind you that it was only the more usual ancient
English name of King Olave, as we are told on good
authority, by the Rev. Alban Butler in his ‘<cite>Lives of
the Fathers, Martyrs, and other principal Saints</cite>,’
London, 1812, 8vo. volume vii. where also, on pages
378-380, you have many further particulars of the
life of this heroic Prince. You may also meet with
him under a variety of other names, as Anlaf, Unlaf,
Olaf Haraldson, Olaus, and Olaf Helge, or Olave the
Holy. Of his Church in Southwark I will tell you
nothing as to its foundation, but remark only that
its antiquity is proved by William Thorn’s ‘<cite>Chronicle
of the Acts of the Abbots of St. Austin’s Canterbury</cite>;’
which is printed in Roger Twysden’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Histori&aelig; Anglican&aelig;
Scriptores Decem</cite>;’ London, 1652, folio. Thorn,
you may remember, was a Monk of St. Augustine’s,
in 1380; and on column 1932 of the volume now referred
to, he gives the copy of a grant from John,
Earl of Warren, to Nicholas, the Abbot of St. Augustine’s,
giving to his Monastery all the estate which
it held in ‘Southwark standing upon the River
Thames, between the Breggehouse and the Church of

that grant was made in the year 1281. And now
I will say no more of St. Olave, but that a very full
and interesting memoir of him, and his miracles, is to
be found in that gigantic work entitled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta

<p>“One of the last notices of London Bridge which
occurs in the days of King Ethelred, and I place it
here because it is without date, is in his Laws, as they
are given in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronicon</cite>’ of John Brompton, Abbot
of Jorvaulx, in the City of York, who lived about the
year 1328. His work was printed in Twysden’s
Scriptores, which I last quoted; and at column 897,
in the xxiii. Chapter of the Statutes there given, is
the following passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘<em>Concerning the Tolls given at Bylyngesgate.</em></p>

<p>‘If a small ship come up to Bilynggesgate, it shall
give one halfpenny of toll: if a greater one which
hath sails, one penny: if a small ship, or the hulk of
a ship come thereto, and shall lie there, it shall give
four pence for the toll. For ships which are filled
with wood, one log of wood shall be given as toll.
In a week of bread’&mdash;perhaps a festival time, ‘toll shall
be paid for three days; the Lord’s day, Tuesday,
and Thursday. Whoever shall come to the Bridge,
in a boat in which there are fish, he himself being a
dealer, shall pay one halfpenny for toll; and if it be
a larger vessel, one penny.’</p>

<p>“Concerning Brompton’s translation of these laws,
Bishop Nicolson, in his ‘<cite>English, Scotch, and Irish
Historical Libraries</cite>,’ London, 1736, folio, page 65,
says that they are pretty honestly done, and given at
large: but they may be seen with several variations
and additions very fairly written in the collections of
Sir Simonds D’Ewes, preserved with the Harleian
Manuscripts in the British Museum, No. 596. John
Brompton, however, at column 891 of his Chronicle,
tells us one circumstance more concerning London
Bridge before the Invasion of Knute; for he says,
under the year 1013, ‘After this, many people were
overthrown in the Thames, at London, not caring to
go by the Bridge;’ that is to say, because it had been
broken in the two recent battles as I have already
told you, and there were also erected several fortifications
about the City.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it was the error of Sweyn in getting his
Fleet foul of London Bridge, which made Knute the
Dane, his Son, go so laboriously to work with the
Thames, upon his Invasion in 1016; and I shall give
you this very wonderful story in the words of the
Saxon Chronicle, page 197. ‘Then came the ships to
Greenwich, and, within a short interval, to London;
where they sank a deep ditch on the South side, and
dragged their ships to the West side of the Bridge.
Afterwards they trenched the City without, so that
no man could go in or out, and often fought against
it; but the Citizens bravely withstood them.’ There
are some who doubt this story, but honest William
Maitland, who loved to get to the bottom of every
thing, as he went sounding about the river for C&aelig;sar’s
Ford, also set himself to discover proofs of Knute’s
Trench: and you may remember that he tells us, in
his work which I have already cited, volume i. page
35, that this artificial water-course began at the great
wet-dock below Rotherhithe, and passing through
the Kent Road, continued in a crescent form to Vauxhall,
and fell again into the Thames at the lower end
of Chelsea Reach. The proofs of this hypothesis were
great quantities of fascines of hazels, willows, and
brushwood, pointing northward, and fastened down
by rows of stakes, which were found at the digging of
Rotherhithe Dock in 1694; as well as numbers of large
oaken planks and piles, also found in other parts.</p>

<p>“Florence of Worcester, who, you will recollect,
wrote in 1101, and died in 1119, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronicon ex
Chronicis</cite>,’ best edition, London, 1592, small 4to. page
413; and the famous old Saxon Chronicle, page
237; also both mention the easy passage of the rapacious
Earl Godwin, as he passed Southwark in the
year 1052. The tale is much the same in each, but perhaps
the latter is the best authority, and it runs thus.
‘And Godwin stationed himself continually before
London, with his Fleet, until he came to Southwark;
where he abode some time, until the flood came up.
When he had arranged his whole expedition, then came
the flood, and they soon weighed anchor and steered
through the Bridge by the South side.’ This relation
is also supported by Roger Hoveden, in his Annals,
Part I. in ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam</cite>,’
by Sir H. Savile, folio 253<sup>b</sup>, line 41.</p>

<p>“And now, worthy Mr. Barbican, before we enter
upon the conjectures and disputes relating to the real
age and founders of the first Wooden Bridge over the
Thames at London, let me give you a toast, closely
connected with it, in this last living relique of old Sir
John Falstaff. You must know, my good Sir, that
when the Church-Wardens and vestry of St. Mary
Overies, on the Bankside yonder, meet for conviviality,
one of their earliest potations is to the memory of their
Church’s Saint and the patroness who feeds them,
under the familiar name of ‘<em>Old Moll!</em>’ and therefore,
as we are now about to speak of them and their
pious foundation most particularly, you will, I doubt
not, pledge me heartily to the Immortal Memory of
Old Moll!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“I very much question,” returned I, “if either the
good foundress of the Church, or she to whom it was
dedicated,&mdash;if Mary the Saint, or Mary the Sinner,&mdash;were
ever addressed by so unceremonious an epithet
in their lives; but, however, as it’s a parochial custom,
and your wish, here’s Prosperity to St. Saviour’s
Church, and the Immortal Memory of Old Moll!”
Mr. Postern having made a low bow of acknowledgment
for my compliance, thus continued.</p>

<p>“I have made it evident then, and, indeed, it is
agreed to on all sides, that there <em>was</em> a Wooden Bridge
over the Thames, at London, at least as early as the
year 1052; and Maitland, at page 44 of his History, is
inclined to believe that it was erected between the
years 993 and 1016, at the public cost, to prevent the
Danish incursions up the River. John Stow, however,
in volume i., page 57, of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ attributes the
building of the first Wooden Bridge over the Thames,
at London, to the pious Brothers of St. Mary’s Monastery,
on the Bankside. He gives you this account on
the authority of Master Bartholomew Fowle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i>
Fowler, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i> Linsted, the last Prior of St. Mary Overies;
who, surrendering his Convent on the 14th of October,
1540,&mdash;in the 30th year of Henry VIII.,&mdash;had a
pension assigned him of &pound;100 per Annum, which it is
well known, that he enjoyed until 1553. This honest
gentleman you find spoken of in John Stevens’s ‘<cite>Supplement
to Sir William Dugdale’s Monasticon Anglicanum</cite>,’
London, 1723, folio, volume ii., page 98; and
from him old Stow states, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> ‘a Ferry being kept in
the place where now the Bridge is built, the Ferryman
and his wife deceasing, left the said Ferry to their
only daughter, a maiden named Mary; which, with
the goods left her by her parents, as also with the profits
rising of the said Ferry, built a house of Sisters in
the place where now standeth the East part of St.
Mary Overies Church, above the choir, where she was
buried. Unto the which house she gave the oversight
and profits of the Ferry. But afterwards, the said
house of Sisters being converted into a College of
Priests, the Priests built the Bridge of Timber, as all
the other great Bridges of this land were, and, from
time to time, kept the same in good reparations. Till
at length, considering the great charges of repairing
the same, there was, by aid of the Citizens of London,
and others, a Bridge built with arches of stone, as
shall be shewed.’</p>

<p>“The first who attacks this story is William Lambarde,
the Perambulator of Kent, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dictionarium
Angli&aelig; Topographicum et Historicum</cite>,’ London, 1730,
quarto, page 176; wherein he scruples not to call
Prior Fowler ‘an obscure man,’ whom he charges with
telling this narrative, ‘without date of time, or warrant
of writing,’ and then sums up his remarks in these
words. ‘As for the first buildinge, I leave it to eche
man’s libertye what to beleve of it; but as for the
name Auderie, I think Mr. Fowler mistoke it, for I
finde bothe in the Recordes of the Queene’s Courtes
and otherwise, it signifieth over the water, as Southrey,
on the South side of the water: the ignorance whereof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
might easily dryve Fowler&mdash;a man belyke unlearned
in the Saxon tongue,&mdash;to some other invention.’</p>

<p>“Maitland and Entick, at page 44 of their History,
are not much more believing than Lambarde, the
Lawyer; for they assert that the Convent of Bermondsey,
founded by Alwin Child, a Citizen of London,
in the year 1082, was the first religious house on
the South side of the River, within the Bills of Mortality.
The second, say they, speaking after Sir William
Dugdale in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monasticon Anglicanum</cite>,’ London,
1661, folio, pages 84, 940, was the Priory of St.
Mary Overies, founded by William Giffard, Bishop
of Winchester, in the reign of King Henry I. Now
Bishop Tanner, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notitia Monastica</cite>,’ best edition
by James Nasmith, Cambridge, 1787, folio, XX.
Surrey,&mdash;for you know the book is unpaged and arranged
alphabetically under Counties, of which Pennant
heavily complains,&mdash;is inclined to think that
Stow was in the right, although he had not discovered
any thing either in print or manuscript to support his
narrative. He is also willing to believe, that Bishop
Giffard did not do more for St. Mary Overies, than
rebuild the body of the Church: and, certainly, that
he did not, in 1106, place Regular Canons there, since
he refers to Matthew of Westminster to prove that they
were then but newly come into England, and placed
in that Church; whilst Bishop Giffard was himself in
exile until the year 1107. The ‘<cite>Domesday Book</cite>,’
also, the most veritable and invaluable record of our
land, thus hints at a Religious House in Southwark;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which, as that Survey was made about the year 1083,
was, of course, long anterior to the times of which I
spake last. You will find the passage in Nichols’
edition of the register, London, 1783, folio, volume i.
<cite>Sudrie</cite>, folio 32&#8201;a, column 1; and the words are as
follow. ‘The same Bishop,’&mdash;that is to say, Odo,
Bishop of Baieux,&mdash;‘has in Southwark one Monastery,
and one Harbour. King Edward held it on the day
he died.’&mdash;January the 5th, 1066&mdash;‘Whoever had the
Church, held it of the King. From the profits of the
Harbour, where ships were moored, the King had two
parts.’ ‘Now,’ concludes the worthy Dr. Tanner,
‘if <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monasterium</cite> here denote any thing more than an
ordinary Church, it may be thought to mean this Religious
House, there being no pretence for any other
in this Borough to claim to be as old as the Confessor’s
time, or, indeed, as the making of the Domesday
Book, A. D. 1083.’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> Sign. U u 2; <cite>Notes</cite> r, and s.</p>

<div>
<p>“Maitland, however, cannot be brought to believe
in the foundation of a Wooden Bridge by the Brethren
of St. Mary; and on page 44 of his work, already
cited, he thus gives the reasons for his non-conformity.
‘As the Ferry,’ he commences, ‘is said to have been
the chief support of the Priory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> ’twould have been ridiculous
in the Prior and Canons, to have sacrificed
their principal dependence, to enrich themselves by a
wild chimera of increasing their revenues in the execution
of a project, which, probably, would have cost
six times the sum of the intrinsic value of their whole
estate; and, when effected, would, in all likelihood,
not have brought in so great an annual sum as the
profits arising by the Ferry, seeing it may be presumed
that foot-passengers would have been exempt from
Pontage.’ He next proceeds to quote a deed of King
Henry I., which I shall produce in its proper order of
time, exempting certain Abbey lands from being
charged with the work of London Bridge: which he
considers as a sufficient proof that the Priests of St. Mary
did not preserve the erection in repair, and therefore,
says he, ‘as the latter part of this traditionary account
is a manifest falsehood, the former <em>is very
likely</em> to be of the same stamp.’ He then sums up all
by these bold words. ‘As it appears that some religious
foundations only were exempt from the work
of this Bridge, and they, too, by charter, <em>I think ’tis
not to be doubted</em>, but all civil bodies and incorporations
were liable to contribute to the repairs thereof.
And, consequently, that Linsted and his followers
exceed the truth, by ascribing all the praise of so
public a benefaction to a small House of Religious;
who, with greater probability, only consented to the
building of this Bridge, upon sufficient considerations
and allowances, to be made to them for the loss of
their Ferry, by which they had been always supported.’
Such are the objections against the attributing
the building of the First Wooden Bridge to the
Monks of Southwark; but we may remark, by the
way, that Stow was a laborious and inquisitive Antiquary,
who saw and inquired, as well as read for
himself, and, in all probability, had both seen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
conversed with Prior Fowle; whilst Maitland and
Entick were often contented to write in their libraries
from the works of others, and speak of places
with which they were but very slightly acquainted.
We may add too, that, as the Priests of St. Mary were
Regular Canons of St. Austin, by their rule they were
not permitted to be wealthy, but were to sell the
whole of their property, give to the poor, have all
things in common, and never be unemployed. I know
very well, that in opposition to Stow’s account of
Mary Audery’s foundation, you may bring forward
that assertion made in Stevens’s ‘<cite>Supplement to Dugdale</cite>,’
which I have already cited, volume ii. page 97;
wherein she is called ‘a noble woman,’ and, consequently,
could not be the Ferryman’s daughter. But
of this let me observe, that the authority of Stow’s
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ given in the margin, is mis-quoted; for although
it is certain that the action itself was sufficiently
noble, yet the old Citizen never calls her other
than ‘a Maiden named Mary.’ You may see the place
to which Stevens refers, in Strype’s edition of the
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume ii. page 10; and let me remark now,
before I quit the history of St. Mary Overies, as connected
with that of London Bridge, that there is yet
extant there, a monumental effigy conveying the strongest
lesson of man’s mortality; it being the resemblance
of a body in that state, when corruption is beginning
its great triumph. Prating Vergers and Sextons commonly
tell you, that the persons whom these figures
represent, endeavoured to fast the whole of Lent, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
imitation of the great Christian pattern, and that dying
in the act, they were reduced to such a cadaverous
appearance at their decease. There has, however, been
a new legend invented for this sculpture, as it is commonly
reported to be that of <span class="smcap">Audery, the Ferryman</span>,</p>

<p class="pc">father of the foundress of St. Mary Overies. It was
formerly placed on the ground, under the North
window of the Bishop’s Court, which, before the present
repairs, stood at the North East corner of the
Chapel of the Virgin Mary. Where it will be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to hereafter, time only can unfold, for, as yet, even the
Churchwardens themselves know not.</p>
</div>

<p>“In speaking of this person’s tomb, I must not,
however, omit to notice, that there is a singularly
curious, although, probably, fabulous tract of 30 pages,
of his life, the title of which I shall give you at length.
‘<em>The True History of the Life and sudden Death of old
John Overs, the rich Ferry-Man of London, shewing,
how he lost his life, by his own covetousness. And of
his daughter Mary, who caused the Church of St. Mary
Overs in Southwark to be built; and of the building of
London Bridge.</em>’ There are two editions of this book,
the first of which was published in 12mo., in 1637, and
a reprint of it in 8vo., which, though it be shorn of
the wood-cuts that decorated the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Editio Princeps</cite>, is,
perhaps, the most interesting to us, inasmuch as it bears
this curious imprint.&mdash;‘<em>London: Printed for T. Harris
at the Looking-Glass, on London Bridge: and sold by
C. Corbet at Addison’s Head, in Fleet-street, 1744.
Price six pence</em>.’ You may see this work in Sir W. Musgrave’s
Biographical Tracts in the British Museum;
its first nine pages are occupied with a definition and
exhortation against covetousness, in the best Puritanic
style of the seventeenth century; and then, on page 10,
the history opens thus:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>‘Before there was any Bridge
at all built over the Thames, there was only a Ferry,
to which divers boats belonged, to transport all passengers
betwixt Southwark and Churchyard Alley,
that being the high-road way betwixt Middlesex, and
Sussex, and London. This Ferry was rented of the
City, by one John Overs, which he enjoyed for many
years together, to his great profit; for it is to be imagined,
that no small benefit could arise from the
ferrying over footmen, horsemen, all manner of cattle,
all market folks that came with provisions to the City,
strangers and others.’</p>

<p>“Overs, however, though he kept several servants,
and apprentices, was of so covetous a soul, that notwithstanding
he possessed an estate equal to that of
the best Alderman in London, acquired by unceasing
labour, frugality, and usury, yet his habit and dwelling
were both strongly expressive of the most miserable
poverty. He had, as we have already seen, an
only daughter, ‘of a beautiful aspect,’ says the tract,
‘and a pious disposition; whom he had care to see well
and liberally educated, though at the cheapest rate;
and yet so, that when she grew ripe and mature for
marriage, he would suffer no man of what condition
or quality soever, by his good will, to have any sight
of her, much less access unto her.’ A young gallant,
however, who seems to have thought more of being
the Waterman’s heir than his son-in-law, took the opportunity,
whilst he was engaged at the Ferry, to be
admitted into her company; ‘the first interview,’ says
the story, ‘pleased well; the second better; but the
third concluded the match between them.&mdash;In all
this interim, the poor silly rich old Ferryman, not
dreaming of any such passages, but thinking all things
to be as secure by land as he knew they were by
water,’ continued his former wretched and penurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
course of life. From the disgusting instances which
are given of this caitiff’s avarice, he would seem to
have been the very prototype and model of Elwes
and Dancer; and, as the title-page of the book sets
forth, even his death was the effect of his covetousness.
To save the expense of one day’s food in his
family, he formed a scheme to feign himself dead for
twenty-four hours; in the vain expectation that his
servants would, out of propriety, fast until after his
funeral. Having procured his daughter to consent to
this plan, even against her better nature, he was put
into a sheet, and stretched out in his chamber, having
one taper burning at his head, and another at his feet,
according to the custom of the time. When, however,
his servants were informed of his decease,
instead of lamenting, they were overjoyed; and,
having danced round the body, they brake open his
larder, and fell to banqueting. The Ferryman bore
all this as long, and as much like a dead man, as he
was able; ‘but, when he could endure it no longer,’
says the tract, ‘stirring and struggling in his sheet,
like a ghost, with a candle in each hand, he purposed
to rise up, and rate ‘em for their sauciness and boldness;
when one of them thinking that the Devil was
about to rise in his likeness, being in a great amaze,
catched hold of the butt-end of a broken oar, which
was in the chamber, and, being a sturdy knave,
thinking to kill the Devil at the first blow, actually
struck out his brains.’ It is added, that the servant
was acquitted, and the Ferryman made accessary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
cause of his own death. The estate of Overs then fell
to his daughter, and her lover hearing of it, hastened
up from the country; but, in riding post, his horse
stumbled, and he brake his neck on the highway.
The young heiress was almost distracted at these
events, and was recalled to her faculties only by having
to provide for her father’s interment; for he was not
permitted to have Christian burial, being considered
as an excommunicated man, on account of his extortions,
usury, and truly miserable life. The Friars of
Bermondsey Abbey were, however, prevailed upon, by
money, their Abbot being then away, to give a little
earth to the remains of the wretched Ferryman. But
upon the Abbot’s return, observing a grave which had
been but recently covered in, and learning who lay
there, he was not only angry with his Monks for having
done such an injury to the Church, for the sake
of gain, but he also had the body taken up again,
laid on the back of his own Ass, and, turning the
animal out at the Abbey gates, desired of God that he
might carry him to some place where he best deserved
to be buried. The Ass proceeded with a gentle and
solemn pace through Kent Street, and along the
highway, to the small pond once called St. Thomas a
Waterings, then the common place of execution, and
shook off the Ferryman’s body directly under the
gibbet, where it was put into the ground, without
any kind of ceremony. Mary Overs, extremely distressed
by such a succession of sorrows, and desirous
to be free from the importunity of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
suitors for her hand and fortune, resolved to retire
into a cloister; which she shortly afterwards did, having
first provided for the foundation of that Church
which still commemorates her name.</p>

<p>“Such is the story related by this tract; and, if it
were possible, one might suppose, that the pious
maiden, out of her filial love, had placed that effigy
in her fane, which I before mentioned to be sculptured
in memory of her father; since it would, by no means,
improperly represent the cadaverous features of the
old Waterman. The figure, itself, is of the third form
of the classes of Sepulchral Monuments, invented by
Maurice Johnson, Esq.,&mdash;namely, tables with effigies
or sculptures,&mdash;and the last of the arrangement
adopted by Smart Lethullier, Esq., that is to say,&mdash;the
representation of a skeleton in a shroud, lying
either under, or on, a table tomb. Richard Gough,
you know, in his ‘<cite>Sepulchral Monuments</cite>,’ London,
1786-96, folio, volume i., part 1, Introduction, page
cxi. where you will find all these particulars, attributes
most of these figures to the fifteenth century,
and Audery certainly died very long before the time
of William I. However this may be, as I am laying
before you all the illustrations of Bridge history, both
authentic and traditional, which are now to be found,
I must not omit to add, that the supposed effigy of
Audery is six feet eight inches in length; and represents
his decayed body lying in its winding-sheet.
His hair is turned up in a roll above his head, though
in the ‘<cite>History of Southwark</cite>,’ by M. Concannen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Junior, and A. Morgan, Deptford, 1795, octavo, page
101, <em>Note</em>, he is erroneously stated to have ‘a shorn
crown,’ and is, therefore, supposed to represent
Linsted, the last Prior of St. Mary’s.</p>

<p>“Captain Francis Grose has inserted this figure,
not very respectably engraven, in his ‘<cite>Antiquities of
England and Wales</cite>,’ London, 1773-87, royal quarto,
six volumes, in the Addenda attached to volume iv.,
plate iii.; and he observes, on page 36, that ‘it is a
skeleton-like figure, of which the usual story is told,
that the person thereby represented attempted to fast
forty days, in imitation of Christ,’ as he remarks on
the preceding page, but died in the attempt, having
first reduced himself to that appearance. The best
engraving of this effigy was published in ‘<cite>Mr. J. T.
Smith’s Antiquities of London, and its Environs</cite>,’ London,
1791, quarto.</p>

<p>“Be this figure, however, who it may, the Waterman
or the Priest, his tomb has outlived both his name
and his dust. Whether he only carried passengers
over the River Thames, or was occupied in teaching
them how to cross that last fatal River,&mdash;which John
Bunyan quaintly tells you hath <em>no</em> Bridge,&mdash;‘after
life’s fitful fever he sleeps well,’&mdash;</p>

<p>“Aye, and so shall I soon,” cried I, stretching myself,
and interrupting Mr. Postern; “let him rest in
peace, my good Sir, and come out of Church now;
for, truly, it’s high time to close your Sermon, and let
us hear somewhat about a River which <em>hath</em> a Bridge,
that was once the wonder of the world.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” replied my narrator, “I thank you,
Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, for recalling me to the subject
of our conversation; for this is the very point at
which I would proceed with my history. You know,
Sir,” continued he, in a much brisker tone, “I have
already observed to you, that the First Wooden
Bridge was erected much farther to the East than
yonder stone bulwark; for when King William I.
granted a Charter to the foundation of St. Peter’s
Abbey, at West-Minster, in the second year of his
reign, A. D. 1067, he confirmed to the Monks serving
God in that place, a Gate in London, then called Butolph’s
Gate, with a Wharf which stood at the head of
London Bridge. This has ever been received as a
well-established fact; for Stow relates it in his
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., pages 22 and 58; and Mr. John
Dart, in his ‘<cite>History and Antiquities of the Abbey
Church of St. Peter, Westminster</cite>,’ London, 1723,
folio, volume i., page 20, supports it, in his List of
Benefactors to the Abbey, in the time of King Edward
the Confessor.</p>

<p>“The record is also given at length, by Stow, in
English; but you may see it in the original Latin, in
a curious Manuscript in the Cotton Library, marked
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Faustina</i>, A. iii., which is entitled, ‘<cite>A Registry of the
Regal and Pontifical Charters, Privileges, Agreements,
and Covenants, of the Bishops and Abbots of the
Church of the blessed Peter of Westminster; many
whereof are Saxon ones, written in the Norman-Saxon
characters.</cite>’ This volume is a little stout quarto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
written in a small fair Church text, on parchment;
adorned with many vermillion initial letters, and
rubrics, or heads of chapters. The Charter to which I
have now referred you, chapter xliv., is the last but
one in the reign of King William I., folio 63, b, of
the modern pagination; and, put into English, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Concerning the lands of Almodus, of St. Butolph’s
Gate, and of the Wharf at the head of London
Bridge.</p>

<p>“‘William, King of England, to the Sheriffs and all
Ministers, as, also, to his faithful subjects of London,
French and English, greeting: Know ye, that I have
granted unto God and to St. Peter of Westminster,
and to the Abbot Vitalis, the House which Almodus,
of the Gate of St. Botolph, gave to them when he was
made a Monk; that is to say, his Lord’s Court, with
his Houses, and one Wharf which is at the head of
London Bridge, and others of his lands in the same
City, like as King Edward more fully and beneficially
granted them: and I will and command that they
shall enjoy the same well, and quietly, and honourably,
with sake and soke, and shall hold all the customs
and laws of the aforesaid. And I defend them that
none shall do them any injury. Witness, Walkeline,
Bishop of Winchester, and William, Bishop of Durham,
and R., Earl of Mell., and Hugh, Earl of Warwick.’</p>

<p>“And now let me remark that, by this we are informed
that the City end of the Bridge was not anciently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the foot of it, which is asserted by the evidence
of Richard Newcourt, in his ‘<cite>Ecclesiastical History of
the Diocess of London</cite>,’ London, 1708-10, folio, volume
i., page 396, where he says, that ‘St. Magnus’ Church
is sometimes called, in Latin, the Church of St.
Magnus the Martyr, in the City of London, near the
foot, or at the foot, of London Bridge.’</p>

<p>“This First Wooden Bridge, however, was not fated
to stand long; for, on the sixteenth of November, the
feast of St. Edmund the Archbishop, in the year 1091,
‘at the hour of six, a dreadful whirlwind from the
South-East, coming from Africa, blew upon the City,
and overthrew upwards of six hundred houses, several
Churches, greatly damaged the Tower, and tore away
the roof and part of the wall of the Church of St.
Mary le Bow, in Cheapside. The roof was carried to
a considerable distance, and fell with such force, that
several of the rafters, being about twenty-eight feet in
length, pierced upwards of twenty feet into the
ground, and remained in the same position as when
they stood in the Chapel.’</p>

<p>“The best accounts of this terrible event are to be
found in the ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>’ of Florence of Worcester,
page 457, which was literally copied into the ‘<cite>Annales</cite>’
of Roger de Hoveden, Chaplain to King Henry II.,
printed in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scriptores post Bedam</cite>,’ already cited,
page 462;&mdash;in William of Malmesbury, page 125;&mdash;and
in the ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>’ of John of Brompton, which
I have also before quoted, page 987.</p>

<p>“During the same storm, too, the water in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Thames rushed along with such rapidity, and increased
so violently, that <em>London Bridge was entirely
swept away</em>; whilst the lands on each side were
overflowed for a considerable distance. I cannot help
observing how slightly, and erroneously, the ‘<cite>Annals
of Waverley</cite>’ notice this most dreadful devastation;
for at page 137, of the best edition by Dr. Thomas
Gale, volume ii. of his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Histori&aelig; Anglican&aelig; Scriptores</cite>
xv.’ Oxford, 1691, folio, they merely state that ‘a
vehement wind struck down London the 6th of the
kalends of November,’&mdash;that is to say, on the 27th of
October,&mdash;‘at the hour of six!’ I doubt not but the
truth was, that the good Monks of Waverley Abbey
in Surrey felt nothing of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ventus vehemens</i> themselves,
and therefore gave a much more trivial record
of it, than if it had shaken but a single bell in the
turrets of their own <em>Cenobium</em>. The ‘<cite>Annals of Waverley</cite>,’
you know, were, down to about 1120, almost
a translation from the ‘<cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite>,’ executed in
the twelfth century. The following year, 1092, the
sixth of the reign of William Rufus, was marked by
a season fatal to bridges in general; although there is
no mention that our’s at London participated in the
destruction. This fact is related by William of
Malmesbury, page 125, and by Roger de Hoveden,
page 464, in these words:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>‘Also, in his sixth year,
there was such an excessive rain, and such high
floods, the rivers overflowing the low grounds that
lay near them, as the like was remembered by none.
And afterward, in the winter, ensued a sudden frost;
whereby the great streams were congealed in such
a manner that they could draw two hundred horsemen
and carriages over them; whilst at their thawing,
many bridges, both of wood and stone, were borne
down, and divers water mills were broken up and
carried away!’</p>

<p>“Frequent destructions by fire seem, also, to have
been a very general fate of all our ancient buildings;
for, in 1093, the wooden houses and straw roofs of
the London Citizens were again in flames, and a great
part of the City was thus destroyed.</p>

<p>“Too soon after this calamity, at a most inauspicious
time for commencing, or executing, expensive public
works, in 1097, King William Rufus imposed a heavy
tax upon his subjects for the re-building of London
Bridge,&mdash;though <em>that</em> might very well be defended,&mdash;the
erecting of the palace of West-Minster Hall, and
the construction of a wall round the Tower. The
‘<cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite>’ speaks of these ill-advised undertakings
in the blended tones of sorrow and of anger.
‘This was, in all things,’ says that faithful old history,
at pages 316, 317, ‘a very heavy-timed year, and
beyond measure laborious from the badness of the
weather, both when men attempted to till the land,
and, afterwards, to gather the fruits of their tilth; and
from unjust contributions they never rested. Many
counties also, that were confined to London by work,
were grievously oppressed, on account of the wall
that was building about the Tower, and <em>the Bridge
that was nearly all afloat</em>, and the King’s Hall that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
they were building at West-Minster; and many men
perished thereby.’</p>

<p>“Our brave old River of Thames itself, however,
is of the same changeful nature as Luna, the mistress
of his tides; for, if at one time, he overflows his banks,
blows up his Bridge, or drowns an invading army,
by the fury of his waves; at another season he contracts
his waters into their narrowest channel, or
draws them back into his urn, without leaving enough
to float a wherry over his bed. Of this I shall give
you several instances, as we get lower down the stream
of time; and now only remark, in chronological
order, that on the 6th of the Ides of October, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">videlicet</i>
the 10th, in the 15th Year of the reign of Henry I.
1114, the River was so dried up, and there was such
want of water, that between the Tower of London
and the Bridge, and even under it, ‘a great number of
men, women, and children,’&mdash;says Stow, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i. page 58,&mdash;‘did wade over both on horse
and foot,’ the water coming up to their knees.</p>

<p>“The original account of this is to be found in the
‘<cite>Annales</cite>’ of Roger de Hoveden, page 473; from
whom we derive the additional information, that this
defect of water commenced in the middle of the
night preceding, and lasted until the darkest part of
the next. The same historian, also, records, on the
same page, that in the year 1115, the winter was so
severe, that all throughout England the Bridges were
broken by the ice.</p>

<p>“But although London Bridge was an edifice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which there was a continual and heavy cost attached,
yet its possessions were, even anciently, very extensive;
for you find that so early as in the 23d year of
Henry I., A. D. 1122, Thomas de Ardern, and Thomas
his son, gave to the Monks of Bermondsey, and the
Church of St. George in Southwark, the tenth of his
Lord’s corn lands in Horndon, and the immense sum
of Five Shillings per annum rent, out of the Lands
pertaining to London Bridge. Calculate this, my
good Sir, at twenty times its present value; for
we know that in the Great Charter of King John,
Chapter II. a knight paid but five pounds to the
King as a Relief when he came to his estate; and
<em>that</em>, Lord Coke tells you in his <cite>Second Institute</cite>, even
several years later, was the fourth part of his annual
income. Remember too, that sixpence by the week
was then a living stipend to an ordinary labourer;
that the Black Book of the Exchequer&mdash;which was
written about the reign of Henry I.&mdash;ordains that a
tenant shall pay one shilling to the King, instead of
providing bread for one hundred soldiers for one
meal; that the provender of twenty horses for one
night, also to be paid by a tenant, was commuted for
four pence; that in 1185, the tenants of Shireburn
paid by custom two pence, or four hens, which they
would; and, lastly, recollect, that in 1125,&mdash;called
by Robert de Monte, the dearest year ever known,&mdash;a
horseload of wheat was sold but for six shillings:
in ordinary times, as in 1043, it was sixpence the
quarter. Of all this you may see most abundant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
curious proof, in Bishop Fleetwood’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronicon Preciosum</cite>,’
London, 1745, 8vo. pages 55, 56; and therefore
the gift of Thomas de Ardern was munificent.</p>

<p>“I should observe that Stow obtained the knowledge
of this donation from the manuscript ‘<cite>Annals of Bermondsey
Priory</cite>,’ which are now preserved in the
Harleian Library in the British Museum, No. 231,
very fairly written in a good legible black text upon
vellum; having vermillion rubrics of the King’s
Reign, and the date of the year. It is a rather small
quarto volume, of 71 written leaves, delicately paged
by some later hand; and the passage occurs on the
reverse of folio 11. The Harleian Catalogue calls it,
in Latin, ‘the Annals of the Abbey of St. Saviour’s of
Bermondesie, from the year of our Lord 1042, down
to the year of our Lord 1433; in which, beside the
public affairs of each reign,’&mdash;told in the words of
other Chronicles&mdash;‘many things are narrated which
belong to the history of the same Abbey.’</p>

<p>“You have already seen that London Bridge was
a public work, to which all England furnished some
labourers; but, as I mentioned some time back,
Maitland, in his ‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ volume i. page
44, notices a deed cited by Stow, exempting the lands
of Battle Abbey, in Sussex. This was granted by
King Henry I. but is perhaps now lost, for it
remains wholly unnoticed by the learned Editors of
the new edition of Dugdale’s ‘<cite>Monasticon</cite>;’ and
I must therefore give it you in the very words of the
old Antiquary himself, who says, page 58, that in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
time it remained with the seal very fair, in the
custody of Joseph Holland, Esq.;&mdash;it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Henry, King of England, to Ralph, Bishop of
Chichester, and all the Officers of Sussex, sendeth
greeting. Know ye, &amp;c. I command by my kingly
authority, that the manor called Alceston, which my
father gave with other lands to the Abbey of Battle,
be free and quiet from shires and hundreds, and all
other customs of earthly servitude, as my father held
the same, most freely and quietly; and namely, <em>from
the work of London Bridge</em>, and the work of the
Castle at Pevensey: and this I command upon my
forfeiture. Witness, William Pont de l’Arche, at
Berry.’</p>

<p>“The second year of the succeeding King, however,
namely Stephen, saw London Bridge in a state
to require the exertions of all England to raise it:
for, in 1136, a fire broke out in the dwelling of one
Aileward, near London Stone, that consumed Eastward
as far as Aldgate; and to the Shrine of St.
Erkenwald, in St. Paul’s Cathedral, to the West. On
the Southern side of London the Wooden Bridge over
the Thames was destroyed, but was soon after repaired,
since Stephanides, whose description of London
was written between 1170 and 1182, speaks of it as
affording a convenient standing place to the spectators
of the Citizens’ Water Tournaments. I shall
give you the whole passage, because it describes a
very curious sport of the twelfth century, which was
celebrated in the immediate vicinity of this very spot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and the account is at page 76, beginning ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In feriis
Paschalibus</i>;’ we’ll content ourselves, however, with
Dr. Pegge’s translation of it, which runs thus.</p>

<p>“‘At Easter, the diversion is prosecuted on the water;
a target is strongly fastened to a trunk or mast, fixed
in the middle of the River, and a youngster standing
upright in the stern of a boat, made to move as fast
as the oars and current can carry it, is to strike the
target with his lance; and if in hitting it he break
his lance, and keep his place in the boat, he gains
his point, and triumphs; but if it happen that the
lance be not shivered by the force of the blow, he is
of course tumbled into the water, and away goes his
vessel without him. However, a couple of boats
full of young men is placed, one on each side of
the target, so as to be ready to take up the unsuccessful
adventurer, the moment he emerges from
the stream, and comes fairly to the surface. The
Bridge, and the balconies on the banks, are filled
with spectators, whose business it is to laugh.’</p>

<p>“Of this singular sport, Joseph Strutt copied in his
‘<cite>Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</cite>,’
London, 1801, 4to. page 92, plate x. a very curious
illumination, contained in a volume of the Royal
Manuscripts in the British Museum,&mdash;2&#8201;B. vii.&mdash;which
consists of a history of the Old Testament,
the Psalter, the Hymns of the Church, and a Calendar;
all richly painted in water-colours, and beautified
with gold,&mdash;‘yellow, glittering, precious gold,’&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
highly embossed, as to be ‘sensible to feeling as to
sight.’</p>

<div>
<p>“That volume brings back old days to my recollection,
whenever I behold it; for, in the year 1553,
it belonged to Queen Mary of England, and is bound
in a truly regal style for her; being in thick boards
covered with crimson velvet, richly embroidered with
large flowers in coloured silks and gold twist; besides
being garnished with gilt brass bosses and
clasps, on the latter of which are engraven the
Royal devices and supporters. Another, and more
pleasing proof of its having been her’s,&mdash;inasmuch
as it records a good action of a London Citizen concerned
with the affairs of this brave river,&mdash;is to be
found in a Latin note written in a beautiful black
text hand, on the reverse of the last leaf of the
volume. ‘This Book,’ it states, ‘formerly a gift,
was afterwards carried away by a sailor; but that
excellent and honest person, Baldwin Smith, Receiver
of the Customs of the Port of London, hath
restored and given it unto the most illustrious Mary,
Queen of England, France, and Ireland, in the
month of October, in the year of our Lord, 1553, in
the first year of her reign.’ The text of this volume
is said to have been written, and the illuminations
executed, in the fourteenth century, though, from
their style, I cannot help thinking that the period is
nearly an hundred years too late; for beneath the
pages of the Psalter is a series of most interesting
and excellent drawings, in pen-and-ink outlines, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
slightly and delicately tinted with colours, which was
certainly a far more ancient custom. However that
may be, this series consists ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de omnibus rebus, et
quibusdam aliis</i>,’ for there are the representations of
animals and birds, field-sports, games, legends, martyrdoms,
battles, and fables, of an almost infinite
variety; and in the course of them occur the figures
of a water-quintain, both as it is described by Fitzstephen,
and also of a more warlike character. The first
of these was engraved by Strutt in the work which
I have before referred to, and gives a very perfect idea
of the <span class="smcap">River Tilting of the Twelfth Century</span>,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="pc">which the illuminator had, no doubt, personally witnessed
in his own time. The other, which has also
been engraven in the same work, page 113, plate xv.
shews two armed knights getting ‘grysly together,’
as the ‘<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morte d’Arthur</cite>’ calls it, in boats;</p>

<p class="pc">and you will find it under the 60th Psalm, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus
repulisti nos</i>,’ &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>“Stow, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i. page 301, mentions
a very rude imitation of this kind of jousting
on the water at London; when he says, ‘I have
seen also in the summer season, upon the River of
Thames, some rowed in wherries, with staves in
their hands, flat at the fore-end, running one against
another, and, for the most part, one or both of them
were overthrown and well ducked.’ In Queen Mary’s
Manuscript, under the psalm of ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Misericordiam et
judicium cantabo</cite>,’ is also a representation of two
fiends hurling a Monk from a rude stone Bridge; but
as I rather think that did not occur at London, I
mention it no farther.</p>

<p>“But now, to return to our subject:&mdash;Stow relates
the particulars of the great fire of 1135-36, at page
58 of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ citing in the margin the ‘<cite>Annals
of Bermondsey</cite>,’ and the ‘<cite>Book of Trinity Priory</cite>,’ as
his authorities. The latter of these is, perhaps, now
no more; but in the former you may find the conflagration
mentioned at page 13&#8201;b, where it is said to
have happened in the year 1135, and to have extended
to the Church of St. Clement Danes. It was
probably in the Register of Trinity Priory, that Stow
found a notice that London Bridge was not only
repaired, but a new one erected of elm timber, in 1163,
by the most excellent Peter of Colechurch, Priest
and Chaplain; since I find it in none of the historians
with whom I am acquainted. It is, however, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
better authenticated that the same pious architect
began his labours upon the first stone one in 1176;
for, in the ‘<cite>Annals of Waverley</cite>,’ at page 161, you find
the following entry.&mdash;‘1176. In this year, the Stone
Bridge at London is begun by Peter, the Chaplain of
Colechurch.’ Here, therefore, ends the history of the
infancy of London Bridge: and a very chargeful
infancy it was, for, as old Stow says, ‘it was maintained
partly by the proper lands thereof, partly by
the liberality of divers persons, and partly by taxations
in divers shires, as I have proved, for the space
of 215 years,’&mdash;And now, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican,
your very good health.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Sir, my hearty thanks to you,” replied I, rubbing
my eyes, “for this Bridge Story is as dull as proving
a Peerage, where there’s no reliance, and much
doubting:&mdash;but how’s this, Master Postern!” continued
I, looking into the tankard, “you have drank,
and I have drank, and yet the jug is as full as ever,
and as hot as it was as first?”</p>

<p>“You’re pleased to be facetious, good Sir,” answered
my visitor, “for truly I’m no Saint Richard
to work such miracles; but, if you please, we’ll now
return to the Bridge again.</p>

<p>“We are here entering upon the golden age of
London Bridge, for the new stone building, by Peter
of Colechurch, was such an ornament as the Thames
had never before witnessed; indeed, in my poor
judgment, it very far surpassed that erection, of which
I shall hereafter have occasion to speak; and perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
for its time, even that which now stretches itself
across the flood. The person to whom was entrusted
the building of the first stone Bridge at London,
was, as I have already told you, named Peter, a Priest
and Chaplain of St. Mary Colechurch; an edifice,
which, until the Great Fire of London, stood on the
North side of the Poultry, at the South end of a
turning denominated Conyhoop Lane, from a Poulterer’s
shop having the sign of three Conies hanging
over it. This Chapel, of which the skilful Peter was
Curate, was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and was
famous as the place where St. Edmund and St.
Thomas &agrave; Beckett were presented at the baptismal
Font; still it must have been something very like
having a church on a first floor, for you may remember
Stow says, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i. page
552, that it was ‘built upon a vault above ground,
so that men are forced to ascend into it by certain
steps.’ Of the architectural knowledge of the Curate
thereof, I have already shewed you that the Citizens
of London had experienced some proofs, since he is
said to have rebuilt their last wooden Bridge: and
John Leland the Antiquary&mdash;whom I shall anon
quote more particularly,&mdash;observes, in the notes to
his famous ‘<cite>Song of the Swan</cite>,’&mdash;a book of which I
will also speak hereafter,&mdash;that Radulphus de Diceto,
Dean of London, who wrote about 1210, states from
his own knowledge, that he was a native of this
City. The same venerable Antiquary also tells us
in his ‘<cite>Itinerary</cite>,’ edited by Thomas Hearne, Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
1768-69, octavo, volume vii. part I. marginal
folio 22, page 12,&mdash;that ‘a Mason beinge Master of
the Bridge Howse, buildyd <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">&agrave; fundamentis</i> the Chapell
on London Bridge, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">&agrave; fundamentis propriis impensis</i>;’
or, as we should now say, from bottom to top, at his
own costs and charges. The property of Peter of
Colechurch, however, would not stand Bridge-building
by itself; and therefore the present will be the most
fitting place, to give you some account of the other
contributors to this great national work.</p>

<p>“Master Leland, in the same place which I last
quoted, observes that ‘a Cardinale, and Archepisshope
of Cantorbyri, gave 1000 Markes or <em>li.</em> to the erectynge
of London Bridge.’ Now, the Cardinal who is here
alluded to, was Hugo, Hugocio, or Huguzen di
Petraleone, a Roman, Cardinal Deacon of St. Angelo,
whom Pope Alexander III. sent, in 1176, to France,
Scotland, and England, as his Legate; which you
may find stated in Alphonso Ciaconio’s noble book
entitled ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vit&aelig; et Res Gest&aelig; Pontificum Romanorum,
et Sanct&aelig; Roman&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig; Cardinalium</cite>,’ Rome,
printed with the Vatican types, in 1630, folio, page
578, a work of about 3000 pages in extent; of an
enormous size, fairly bound in embossed vellum, and
adorned with a prodigious number of copper-plates
and wood-cut Armorial Ensigns; by the latter of
which we are shewn, that this foreign contributor
to the building of London Bridge bore for his arms,
Quarterly, Argent and Gules, and over all, in the centre
point, a sieve of the first. Whilst the Cardinal resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in England, he took some notice of the dispute
which was then going on concerning the Primacy,
between the Archbishops of Canterbury and York:
when at a meeting held at Westminster, Roger de
Ponte, the turbulent possessor of the latter see, arrogantly
took his seat at the Cardinal’s right hand.
Upon which the domestics of Richard, the mild and
amiable Archbishop of Canterbury, took him thence by
force, and in the ensuing scuffle he was beaten, and
turned out of the assembly, with his episcopal robes
sadly rent. Now this Richard was a Benedictine Monk,
and Prior of the Monastery of St. Martin’s, Dover;
who was elected to the See of Canterbury on the
death of Thomas &agrave; Beckett, in 1174. ‘He was a
man,’ says Bishop Godwin, when writing his memoirs,
‘very liberal, gentle, and passing wise;’ and, what
gives him great honour in <em>my</em> sight, he was the very
Prelate whom Leland mentions in the passage I
quoted, as subscribing so nobly to the foundation of
London Bridge. And yet, ’tis strange, that only in
his ‘<cite>Itinerary</cite>,’ and in Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i. page
58, is this donation recorded; for even in the best
and most splendid edition of Bishop Godwin’s volume,
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Pr&aelig;sulibus Angli&aelig; Commentarius</cite>,’ by William
Richardson, Canon of Lincoln, Cambridge, 1743,
folio, page 79, the old Citizen is referred to at note <em>y</em>,
as his authority for the fact. I cannot omit now
giving you the blazon of this Prelate’s own arms, as
they appear in that noble illuminated copy of Archbishop
Parker’s work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Antiquitate et Privilegiis
Ecclesi&aelig; Cantuariensis cum Archiepiscopis ejusdem 70</cite>,’
Lambeth, 1572, folio, page 123, which is estimated to
be fully worth its weight in gold. This truly valuable
volume was presented by our late good King
George the Third to the British Museum, and formerly
belonged to Queen Elizabeth. The arms,
however, were Azure, three Mullets in bend, between
two Cottises Argent; and whenever you turn to this
volume, on which the ancient Art of Illuminating
shed its latest rays, I pray you fail not carefully to
inspect it: for you will find it a copy of that edition
printed at his own palace, by John Day; with many
leaves impressed on vellum, and the whole of the
book carefully ruled with red-ink lines, the initials
coloured and gilded, and all the Armorial Ensigns,
with the Frontispiece, excellently well emblazoned.
And I pray you also, forget not well to note the
binding; since a richer, or more fancifully embroidered
covering there are few tomes which can exhibit. The
ground of it is green velvet, intended to represent the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vert</i> of a park, and it is surrounded by a broad border
of pales with a gate, worked in brown silk and gold
twist; whilst within are trees, flowers, shrubs, tufts
of grass, serpents, hinds, and does, all executed in
richly coloured silks, and gold and silver wire. At
the back are the Queen’s badges of red and white
roses; the edges of the leaves are gilt, and the volume
was once secured by ribbons of crimson silk.</p>

<p>“Of this most splendid book I must, indeed, yet add
another word, that it may be estimated as it so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
deserves. Dr. Ducarel, in his account of that astonishing
copy of it which is deposited in the Archiepiscopal
Palace at Lambeth, says, ‘It was first
printed at Lambeth by John Daye in 1572; and so
small a number were then published, that, except this
complete copy, there is but one extant in England,
known to be so, which is preserved in the Public
Library of Cambridge, as I am informed.’ See his
Letter of July the 15th, 1758, addressed to Archbishop
Secker, which is inserted in the Rev. H. J.
Todd’s ‘<cite>Catalogue of the Archiepiscopal Manuscripts
in Lambeth Palace</cite>.’ London, 1812, folio, page 242,
Art. 959.</p>

<p>“The life of Archbishop Richard, which this
book contains, is nearly the same as that related by
Francis Godwin, Bishop of Landaff; and before I
leave speaking of this early and Reverend patron of
London Bridge, let me endeavour to clear his memory
from something like a stain which attaches to it. He
received the Archbishop’s Pall, immediately after the
death of a man of unconquerable spirit and insurmountable
pride, for you will remember that he was
successor to Beckett: and, perhaps, it was the strong
contrast afforded by his yielding and quiet disposition,
which has made some suppose that he did nothing
worthy of memory. I am, however, myself rather
surprised at the manner of his decease, when it is
allowed by all his biographers, that he was a man so
charitable, of such benefit to the revenues of the
church, and was so liberal both to the poor, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
nation, the King, and even the Pontiff himself. The
story of his death is related by Gervase of Dover, by
Henry Knyghton, the Canon of Leicester, and in
the Chronicle of William Thorne, the Monk of St.
Augustine’s, Canterbury; but I shall recite it to you
from the old English edition of Francis Godwin’s
‘<cite>Catalogue of the Bishops of England, from the first
planting of the Christian Religion in this Island:</cite>’
London, 1615, 4to. page 96. ‘The end of this man,’
says the Prelate, ‘is thus reported, how that being
a sleepe at his Mannor of Wrotham, there seemed to
come vnto him a certaine terrible personage’&mdash;Knyghton
and Thorne say ‘the Lord appeared unto
his sight,’&mdash;‘demaunding of him, who he was; whereunto,
when for feare, the Archbishop answered
nothing, Thou art he, quoth the other, that hast
destroyed the goods of the Church, and I will destroy
thee from off the earth: this having said, he vanished
away. In the morning betime, the Archbishop got
him up, and taking his iourney toward Rochester,
related this fearfull vision vnto a friend of his by the
way. Hee had no sooner told the tale, but hee was
taken suddenly with a great cold and stifenesse in
his limmes, so that they had much adoo to get him
so farre as Haling, a house belonging to the Bishop
of Rochester. There he tooke his bed, and being
horribly tormented with the cholike, and other greefes,
vntill the next day, the night following, the 16th of
February, hee gaue vp the ghost, anno 1183.’</p>

<p>“Though such was his untimely end, yet his being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
so great a benefactor to the original building of old
London Bridge, ought to make his name revered by
every true-hearted Citizen of London; and, indeed,
Bridge-building has been thought by some to be an
act of real piety, witness those rude old verses
printed in Leland’s ‘<cite>Itinerary</cite>,’ volume vii. part I.
Marginal folio 64&#8201;b, page 79, which were composed on
the erecting of the Bridge at Culham, in Oxfordshire,
and hung up by Master Richard Fannand, Ironmonger,
of Abingdon, in the Hall of St. Helen’s
Hospital.</p>

<p>“By this then, you see there is much virtue in
your Bridge-builder. The names of all the Benefactors
to London Bridge, indeed, were fairly painted
on a tablet, and hung up in St. Thomas’s Chapel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which stood upon the middle of it; and, doubtless,
the donation of King Henry II. would be found there
recorded, if that grateful testimonial were yet in
existence. The King’s gift, however, is supposed to
have been, in fact, the gift of the people, being the
produce of a tax upon wool; and hence arose that
absurd tradition, which the commonalty invented to
make a wonder of the matter, that ‘London Bridge
was built upon woolpacks,’ I am, indeed, inclined
to think that the measure was not very popular; for
the people of England seldom failed to complain of
any additional duty placed upon that commodity;
and of this you find some reliques in Lord Coke’s
Commentary on the 30th Chapter of the ‘<cite>Magna
Charta</cite>’ of King Henry III., contained in his ‘<cite>Second
Institute</cite>,’ pages 58, 59. He is there speaking, you
know, of the taking away of evil tolls and customs,
and he observes, that some have supposed that there
was a tribute due to the King by the Common Law,
upon all wools, wool-fells,&mdash;that is, the undressed
sheep skins,&mdash;and leather, to be taken as well of the
English as of strangers, known by the name of
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiqua Custuma</cite>. This amounted to half a mark, or
6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> for every sack of wool of 26 stone weight; and
a whole mark upon every last of leather. But even
this his Lordship also endeavours to prove a recent
custom, by a Patent Roll from the Exchequer, of
the 3rd of Edward I., A. D. 1274, which states,
that the Prelates, Chiefs, and the whole Common
Council of the kingdom, had consented to grant this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
new custom of wool to him, and to his heirs. Now,
even the words ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novam consuetudinem</i>’ may signify
only a revival of the ancient tax, for some specific
cause; as it might have lain dormant since the days
of building London Bridge; thus having reference
to a new occasion, and not to the date. But shortly
previous to the final confirmation of the Great and
Forest Charters, however, in the 25th of Edward I.,
1296, the King set a new toll of forty shillings upon
every sack of wool, without the consent of his Parliament;
which the Commonalty felt to be a very
heavy imposition. Against this they petitioned, and in
the aforesaid ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Confirmationes Chartarum</cite>,’ Chapter vii.
it was provided that such things should be abolished,
and not taken, but by common consent and good
will; excepting the customs before granted. There
appears to me, however, even a still nearer connection
between the Duties raised for the building of London
Bridge, and the xxiii. Chapter of the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Charta</cite>’
of King John, for you there find that ‘No City, nor
Freeman, shall be distrained to make Bridges or water-banks,
but such as have of old been accustomed to
do so:’ from which it is evident, that the taxation
was general, and that this instrument was to make it
particular; though, according to Lord Coke’s exposition,
there was nothing gained by it: for, in his
‘<cite>Second Institute</cite>,’ folio 29, he says, that in the reigns
of Richard I. and John, fictitious exactions were
made in the names of Bridges, Bulwarks, and the
like, but that neither the erection, nor the paying for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them, was abolished by this act, since they could not
be erected but by the King himself, or by an Act of
Parliament.&mdash;But Mr. Barbican!&mdash;You doze, worthy
Sir!”</p>

<p>“Why truly, Mr. Postern,” said I, rubbing my
eyes, “Tax-gathering is always dull work; and I
verily thought we’d lost sight of the Bridge in the
paying for it. You’re as minute with all your authorities,
as a Flemish painter that marks every hair on
a cat’s back, and I can turn over your old dull authors
in my own dusty book-room.”</p>

<p>“I must acknowledge,” said my visitor, “that
such details are rather dry; but you very well know,
my good friend, as Father Le Long said, ‘Truth is
so delightful, that we should consider no labour too
great to obtain it:’ and, indeed, I wished to bring
before you some circumstances which lie widely scattered,
although they, nevertheless, most excellently
illustrate the story, and I would do all honour to the
memory of the worthy Peter of Colechurch.”</p>

<p>“Really, Sir,” answered I, “if his blessing be
worth having, it ought to rest upon your head; for
had you been Peter of Colechurch himself, ten times
over, you could scarcely have taken more pains with
your history: and so,&mdash;here’s your health, and his,
Mr. Barnaby.”</p>

<p>“My best thanks to you, my honoured friend,”
replied Mr. Postern, “and I’ll shortly repay your
attention by a piece of a more brilliant description;
for having once got the Bridge built, and paid for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
we’ll take a look at the picturesque old edifice itself,
and at some of the many gorgeous sights and interesting
scenes which took place upon it: indeed it
shall go hard but what I’ll find you amusement. The
building, then, which the never-to-be-forgotten Peter
of Colechurch began, took as long to complete as
Solomon’s Temple, for thirty and three years were
employed in erecting it. Ere that period, however,
the charitable Priest who designed it, the learned
Architect and wise builder who watched its progress,
went the way of all flesh; as we shall find hereafter,
in 1205, and not, as Maitland erroneously says, in the
third of King John, A. D. 1201, though he also supposes
that he might then be worn out by age or
fatigue, since in the Patent Rolls of the Tower of
London, of that year, M. 2, No. 9, is the following
Letter Missive of the King to the Mayor and Citizens
of London, recommending a new Architect. For other
references you may consult Maitland’s History, page
45; Thomas Hearne’s edition of the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger
Scaccarii</cite>,’ London, 1771, octavo, volume i. page *470,
where it is printed in the original Latin; and the
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calendarium Rotulorum Patentium in Turri Londinensi,
Printed by Command</i>,’ London, 1802, folio,
page 1, column 1. The Letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘John, by the Grace of God, King of England,
&amp;c. to his faithful and beloved the Mayor and Citizens
of London, greeting. Considering how the Lord in
a short time hath wrought in regard to the Bridges
of Xainctes and Rochelle, by the great care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pains of our faithful, learned, and worthy Clerk,
Isenbert, Master of the Schools of Xainctes: We
therefore, by the advice of our Reverend Father in
Christ, Hubert, (Walter) Archbishop of Canterbury,
and that of others, have desired, directed, and enjoined
him to use his best endeavour in building your
Bridge, for your benefit, and that of the public: For
we trust in the Lord, that this Bridge, so requisite
for you, and all who shall pass the same, will, through
his industry, and the divine blessing, soon be finished.
Wherefore, without prejudice to our right, or that of
the City of London, we will and grant, that the rents
and profits of the several houses which the said
Master of the Schools shall cause to be erected upon
the Bridge aforesaid, be for ever appropriated to
repair, maintain, and uphold the same. And seeing
that the requisite work of the Bridge cannot be accomplished
without your aid, and that of others, we
charge, and exhort you, kindly to receive and honour
the above-named Isenbert, and those employed by
him, who will perform every thing to your advantage
and credit, according to his directions, you affording
him your joint advice and assistance in the premises.
For whatever good office or honour you shall do to
him, you ought to esteem the same as done to us.
But, should any injury be offered to the said Isenbert,
or to the persons employed by him, which we do not
believe there will, see that the same be redressed so
soon as it comes to your knowledge. Witness myself,
at Molinel,’&mdash;in the Province of Bourbon, in France,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>‘the
eighteenth day of April.’ ‘A Letter,’ adds Hearne,
on page *471, ‘of the same form, was written to all the
King’s faithful subjects constituting the realm of
England;’ and the instrument itself is also to be
found at length in the original Latin, in Sir Symonds
D’Ewes’ extracts from the Records, Harleian MSS.
in the British Museum, No. 86, page 1&#8201;a.</p>

<p>“It is, however, by no means clear, notwithstanding
this Royal Writ, that Isenbert was employed by the
Citizens to complete the building of London Bridge;
indeed, the Rev. John Entick, in his edition of Maitland’s
‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ volume i. page 45, imagines
quite otherwise, because he found that King John, in
the seventh year of his reign, 1205, three years, as <em>he</em>
says, before the Bridge was finished, granted the custody
of it to one Friar West, taking it from the Lord
Mayor, and obliging the City to apply certain void
places within its walls to be built on for its support.
Strype also quotes the former instrument as being yet
preserved in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Clausi</cite>,’ or Close Rolls, in the
Tower, 7 John, c. 19, for you know it was a private
instrument, and therefore sealed up, and directed to
the persons whom it specially concerned.</p>

<p>“But now let us see how far this supposition is
founded in truth. In the first place, the reference to
the Close Rolls is erroneous, for the writ is to be
found on the 15th Membrane, there being no such
article as c. 19; and, in the next place, there was
no such person as Friar West, for the title of Friar
was not in use until the fourteenth century, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
person referred to was called <em>Wasce</em>, though the
name of West has been copied and re-copied, and the
error thus perpetuated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. The actual
words of the writ are, in English, as follow.</p>

<p>“‘The King to Geoffrey Fitz Peter, &amp;c.’&mdash;Chief
Justice of England.&mdash;‘We will that Brother Wasce, our
Almoner, and some other lawful man of London, provided
by you and the Mayor of London, be Attorney
for the custody of London Bridge. And, therefore, we
command you that they give the whole to these men,
like as Peter, the Chaplain of Colechurch, possessed
the same from them. Witness for the same, the
Prior of Stoke, at Marlebridge, the 15th day of September.’
Notwithstanding this instrument, we hear
no more of Frater Wasce, nor of Isenbert of Xainctes,
but are told by Stow, page 58, without his referring
to any other authority, that ‘this work, to wit
the Arches, Chapel, and Stone Bridge over the
Thames at London, having been thirty-three years in
building, was, in the year 1209, finished by the worthy
Merchants of London, Serle Mercer, William Almaine,
and Benedict Botewrite, principal masters of that
work.’</p>

<div>
<p>“This new Bridge consisted, then, of a stone platform,
erected somewhat westward of the former,
926 feet long, and 40 in width, standing about 60 feet
above the level of the water; and containing a Drawbridge,
and 19 broad pointed arches, with massive
piers varying from 25 to 34 feet in solidity, raised upon
strong elm piles, covered by thick planks, bolted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
together. Such was the <span class="smcap">first stone London Bridge</span>,
commenced by <span class="smcap">Peter of Colechurch</span>, A. D. 1176.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Deeply as I venerate the memory of the great
builder of that Bridge, which continued for so many
centuries the wonder of Europe, yet I must not omit
to notice to you, that many persons have grievously
condemned his labours; the principal objections to
which are summed up in the ‘<cite>Londinium Redivivum</cite>,’
of Mr. James Peller Malcolm, London,
1802-1807, 4to. volume ii. page 386, where he thus
heavily censures that erection. ‘Whatever were the
pretensions of Peter of Colechurch to eminence as an
Ecclesiastical Architect, I think any person who views
Vertue’s print of London Bridge, as it stood in 1209,
will allow that he was a very bad Civil Engineer.
He seems to have delighted in the number of his
piers, which amounted to nineteen; and he was so
ignorant of the true principles by which he should
have been governed, that the centre was swelled into
a Chapel, reducing the adjoining arches to half the
diameter of the remainder. Indeed, it is wonderful
that those piers maintained their situation, when we
reflect how the torrent now rushes through, hurling
heavy laden barges along as if they were feathers on
the stream, when every practicable remedy to enlarge
them has been applied.’</p>

<p>“An Architect of nearly an hundred years since,
however, has considered these objections with somewhat
more of mathematical proof; and what is better,
even whilst he admits their full force, he still venerates
the memory, and dares to applaud the public
spirit, of the blessed Peter of Colechurch. You will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
readily guess that I allude to Master Nicholas
Hawksmoor’s ‘<cite>Short Historical Account of London
Bridge, with a proposition for a New Stone Bridge at
Westminster</cite>,’ a quarto pamphlet of 47 pages, and 5
folding Copper-plates, originally published in the
year 1736, for two shillings. The Author observes,
at page 9, that the whole breadth of the River from
North to South is nearly 900 feet, and that in his
time there were eighteen solid piers of different dimensions,
varying from 34 to 25 feet in thickness.
According to this disposition, he argues, ‘the greatest
water way is when the tide is <em>above</em> the sterlings, which
is 450 feet, and, considering the impediments, it is not
half the width of the River for the water to pass; but
when the tide is fallen <em>below</em> the sterlings, the water-way
is reduced to 194 feet,&mdash;which is during the greatest
part of the flux and reflux of the tide,&mdash;and the river of
900 feet broad, is forced through a channel of 194 feet,
which is not a quarter of the whole.’ We can at last,
however, hardly judge of the Bridge of Peter of
Colechurch with any degree of fairness, for that
great benefactor of London died before he completed
his <em>Pontificate</em>, as I may jocularly call it; and the author
whom I last quoted, very candidly observes of
him, that he, perhaps, ‘did not intend to add those
immense Sterlings that have so much obstructed
the River’s passage betwixt the Stone piers,’ and
which, after all, are the great cause of the evil: for,
says the same person, at page 13, when answering the
common objection to altering London Bridge, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
account of the expense attending it, ‘I have heard
some masters of Hoys and Lighters say, that a Tonnage
would willingly be paid for such a conveniency
and security of their goods and vessels; and, as I
have heard, an offer <em>was</em> made to pay Tonnage, if the
Drawbridge had been opened, when the City last
repaired it, to avoid the losses they suffered frequently
by the Sterlings.’ ‘It is very probable,’ continues
the same authority, ‘that the Sterlings were made
afterwards, to keep the foundation of the piers from
being undermined;&mdash;or, perhaps, these Sterlings
might be increased after some damages that befell the
piers, by the great quantity of ice which might be
stopt by the narrowness of the arches; and those
that intended to make the legs more secure, used
such means as rendered them the less so, by the
violent rapidity which they gave to the River so
restrained,’ In addition to this, he also attempts an
apology even for that very part of Peter’s Bridge,
which has been the most condemned; having, perhaps,
designed, says Mr. Hawksmoor, ‘by the narrowness
of his arches, to restrain the ebbing of the tide, the
better to preserve the navigation of the River above
the Bridge, though it would not have any great effect
if the Sterlings were taken away,’ considering ‘that if
the River had its free course, it would ebb away so
fast, that there would be scarce any navigation above
the Bridge, a little time after high-water.’ This
pamphlet also contains a defence of the Great Pier,
which so violently excited the censure of Malcolm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
who thought a Church on a Bridge was thrown away;
for at page 12, he states that it might be intended
‘firstly to be a steadying of the whole machine, instead
of making an angle, as it is in the famous Bridge at
Prague, and in some of the Bridges in France; so
that this fortress was placed in the middle of the
Bridge, to stem the violence of the floods, ice, and all
other accidents that might be forced against it. Secondly,&mdash;that
if by any accident of the ice or flood,
or undermining any of the legs,’&mdash;he means the piers,
but Hawksmoor frequently uses this very ungraceful
epithet,&mdash;‘some of the arches might fall, as five did,
Anno 1282, yet, by the help of this great buttress,&mdash;though
this damage was done on one side,&mdash;the arches
on the other side stood firm, so that there was less
expense, and greater encouragement to make the repair.
The third reason was, that he had an opportunity to
shew his piety, having a situation for erecting a Chapel,
which was done, and his body deposited in it.’</p>

<p>“At the great repair of London Bridge, which took
place between 1757 and 1770, several additional arguments
were brought forward against the original edifice;
of which Mr. Robert Mylne, in his Answers to the
Select Committee of the House of Commons, for improving
the Port of London, dated May the 15th, and
October the 30th, 1801, printed in the Fourth Report
of that Committee, states the following particulars.
‘The houses,’ says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> ‘being then taken down, and
the sides of the Bridge being dismantled, the internal
masses of its great bulk were found little better than
rubbish, and of bad mason-work, &amp;c. without active
exertion, or even inert resistance. The original
Piles, under the original stone-work of a very narrow
Bridge, between the two modern sides and extreme
parts, by cutting into the sides of the piers, and by
one old being opened up, and totally removed, have
been found composed of Sapling Oak and some Elm,
carelessly worked, neither round nor square, but
much decayed.’</p>

<p>“And now, worthy Mr. Barbican, having told you
some of the objections to, and apologies for, the Bridge
of the venerable Peter of Colechurch, before we
ascend to the parapet, to examine the buildings which
stood upon it, let me observe to you, that there are
engraved Ground-plans of this Bridge, in George
Vertue’s prints, which I shall mention more particularly
hereafter, and also in Hawksmoor’s tract
from which I have so largely quoted.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here let me for a moment interrupt the narrative
of Mr. Postern, by stating that on the next
page the Reader has a reduced copy of the interesting
plan last mentioned, to which are subjoined Hawksmoor’s
own measurements, and some additional particulars,
also taken from Vertue; on the accuracy of
every part of which, we have the best authority for
placing the most complete reliance.</p>

<p>The Piers and Arches were both measured from the
squares of the latter, the triangular ends being left un-noticed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
excepting in the instance of the Great Pier. The
length of the whole Bridge was 926 feet; its height,
60; and the breadth of the Street over it, 40 feet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div>
<div>
<p>“Let us now then, my good Sir,” continued Mr.
Postern, “ascend to the Platform or Street of the old
London Bridge, erected by Peter of Colechurch, and
look at the buildings which stood upon it; the most
celebrated of which was the famous Chapel dedicated
to St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, the Martyr of Canterbury,
whence it was familiarly called St. Thomas of the
Bridge. This was erected upon the Tenth, or Great
Pier, which measured 35 feet in breadth, and 115
from point to point; whilst the edifice itself was 60
feet in length, by 20 feet broad, and stood over the
parapet on the Eastern side of the Bridge, leaving
a pathway on the West, about a quarter of the
breadth of the Pier, in front of the Chapel. The
face of the building itself was forty feet in height,
having a plain gable, surmounted by a cross of about
six feet more; whilst four buttresses, crowned by
crocketted spires, divided the Western end into three
parts. The wide centre contained a rich pointed-arch
window, of one mullion, with a quatrefoil in the
top; and the two sides were occupied by the entrances
to the Chapel from the Bridge-Street, each
being ascended by three steps. Such was the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
appearance of the <span class="smcap">West Front of the Chapel on
London Bridge</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/103.jpg" width="400" height="390" alt="" title="West Front of the Chapel on London Bridge." />
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>“The interior of this edifice consisted of two
stories, both consecrated to sacred purposes, and
greatly resembling each other in their appearance.
The Upper Chapel was lofty, being supported by
fourteen groups of elegant clustered columns, and
lighted by eight pointed-arch windows divided by
stone mullions into a double range of arches, surmounted
by a lozenge. Beneath each of the windows
were three arched recesses, separated by small pillars;
and the roof itself was also originally formed of lofty
pointed arches; though, when this magnificent fane was
transformed into a warehouse, a wooden ceiling, with
stout beams crossing each other in squares, was erected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
which cut off the arches where they sprang from the
pillars, and divided into two parts the <span class="smcap">Interior of
the Upper Chapel of St. Thomas</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>The Eastern extremity of this building formed a
semi-hexagon, having a smaller window in each of
its divisions, with richly carved arches under them,
corresponding with the series already mentioned on
the side: and the architectural lightness and elegance
of the whole, meriting the highest encomium. Beneath
this principal edifice, was a short descending
passage, having, on the left hand, a stone basin cut in
a recess in the wall, for containing Holy Water, and
leading, through the solid masonry of the Pier, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Lower Chapel of St. Thomas</span>, which was constructed
in the Bridge itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/105.jpg" width="500" height="294" alt="" title="Lower Chapel of St. Thomas." />
</div>

<p>“This <span class="smcap">Crypt</span> was entered both from the upper
apartment and the street, as well as by a flight of
stone stairs winding round a pillar, which led into
it from the nearest Pier: whilst in the front of this
latter entrance, the Sterling formed a platform at low
water, which thus rendered it accessible from the
River. The Lower Chapel, which&mdash;even decorated
as <em>that</em> was, in my estimation, very far exceeded the
upper one in architectural beauty,&mdash;was about 20
feet in height, and its roof supported by clustered
columns, similar to those I have already described;
from each of which sprang seven ribs, the centre, and
the two adjoining it in every division, being bound
by fillets with roses on the intersections; whilst the
great horizontal ribs had clusters of regal and ecclesiastical
masks, producing an effect little to be expected
in such a structure, in such a situation; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I may trust to your correct taste, my good Mr. Barbican,
for duly appreciating it. There was also a rich
<span class="smcap">Series of Windows in the Lower Chapel</span>,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/106.jpg" width="450" height="186" alt="" title="Series of Windows in the Lower Chapel." />
</div>

<p class="pc">which looked on to the water, similar in character to,
though much smaller than, those above: whilst the
floor was beautifully paved with black and white marble;
for in this place did the pious Architect propose
to rest his bones. His monument, remarkable only
for its plainness, was formed, according to Maitland’s
‘<cite>History</cite>,’ page 46, under the Chapel staircase, in the
middle of the building; and it measured seven feet
and an half, by four in breadth. There was, indeed,
neither brass plate, nor inscription, nor carving found
about the sepulchre, when Mr. Yaldwin, the inhabitant
of the Chapel in 1737, then a dwelling, and
warehouse, discovered the remains of a body in repairing
the staircase; though, from the ‘<cite>Annals of
Waverley</cite>,’ page 168, we know that the reliques of
Peter were certainly entombed in this place. ‘In
1205,’&mdash;runs the passage,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>‘died Peter the Chaplain
of Colechurch, who began the Stone Bridge at London,
and he is sepultured in the Chapel upon the Bridge.’
By this entry then, we are assured that he lay there;
and as for an epitaph, was not the whole edifice an
everlasting catafalco to his memory, which should
speak for all times? How finely, indeed, might we
apply to him that inscription, which the son of Sir
Christopher Wren composed for his father’s burial-place
in St. Paul’s,&mdash;‘He lived, not for himself, but
for the public! Reader, if you seek his monument,
look around you!’</p>
</div>

<p>“And now, before we enter upon an examination
of the bed of the Thames at London Bridge, and consider
whether the River were turned, as Stow thinks,
to admit of its erection, let me cite you some ancient
authorities concerning St. Thomas’s Chapel. The
first of these shall be the ‘<cite>Itinerary of Symon Fitz
Simeon, and Hugo the Illuminator</cite>,’ both of whom were
Irish Monks, of the Order of Friars Minors, who
visited London on their pilgrimage to Palestine, in
1322. ‘This flux and reflux,’&mdash;say they, at pages 4, 5,&mdash;‘continues
to the sea from the famous River named
Thames, upon the which is a Bridge, filled with inhabitants
and wealth; and in the midst of them is a
Church dedicated to the blessed Thomas, Archbishop
and Martyr, which is well served continually.’ About
the year 1418, also, William Botoner, a Monk of
Worcester, of the Parish of St. James in Bristol, who
then travelled from that City to St. Michael’s Mount in
Cornwall, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itinerarium</cite>,’ pages 301, 302, thus
spake of London Bridge and the Chapel. ‘The length
of the Chapel of St. Thomas the Martyr, upon London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Bridge, is about twenty yards; having an under
Chancel in the vault, with a choir, but the length of
the nave of the said Chapel contains fourteen yards.
The width of the middle steps is one yard. The
length of the Bridge on the South, from the posts to
the first gate newly founded by Henry the Cardinal,
unto the two posts erected near the Church of St.
Magnus, consists of five hundred of my steps. <em>Item</em>:
there are five great windows on one side,’&mdash;of the
Chapel,&mdash;‘each of which contains three panes:’ or
rather divisions. Of these Itineraries I will observe
nothing farther, than that they were published from
the original Manuscripts in Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, by James Nasmith, the Editor of Tanner’s
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notitia Monastica</cite>;’ in 1778, octavo; under the
title of ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itineraria Symonis Simeonis, et Willielmi de
Worcestre</cite>.’</p>

<p>“Of this Chapel, and also of the first Stone Bridge,
there are two large folio engravings, taken and published,
by George Vertue, in 1744-48, which, after
his decease, were, with many of his other plates of
Antiquities, presented by his widow to the Antiquarian
Society in 1775. The first engraving measures
18&frac14; inches by 20 inches and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, and contains ‘A View
of the West Front of the Chappel of St. Thomas,
on London Bridge; also the Inside View from West
to East of the said Chappel, as it was first built
An&deg;. 1209:’&mdash;and also ‘London Bridge as it was
first built, An&deg;. 1209:’&mdash;a Ground plan, and some
measurements of the same, and a short Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
account of the structure, drawn up by Sir Joseph
Ayloffe, Bart. Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries.
The publication line states, that it was
‘drawn, engrav’d, and publish’d by G. Vertue, in
Brownlow-Street, Drury-Lane, 1748.’ A second
edition was printed by the Society, in 1777.</p>

<p>“The other plate contains ‘The Inside Perspective
View of the Under Chappel of St. Thomas within London
Bridge, from the West to the East end,’ and beneath
it: the ‘Inside South View of the Under Chappel
from East to West, representing the manner and form
of this rare piece of Ancient Architecture, thus drawn
and transmitted to posterity, by G. V., Antiquary,
1744. Published and sold by G. Vertue, in Brownlow-Street,
Drury-Lane, 1747’ This plate, which measures
18&frac14; inches by 20, contains a few additional historical
notes, by Sir Joseph Ayloffe; and a reduced copy of
the lower View was engraved in the 23d volume of
the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,’ for October, 1753, page
520. I must observe, also, that, in the large interior
View on that plate of Vertue last-mentioned, there are
introduced the portraits of the learned Samuel Gale,
and the eccentric Dr. Ducarel. The former, by whose
patronage and assistance Vertue produced these prints,
is standing on the left hand, holding a plan of the
Chapel, and listening to an outlandish-looking man,
designed for Peter of Colechurch; whilst the latter
Antiquary is employed in measuring. You find this
information given from Gale’s own lips, in that monument
of labour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> ‘<cite>Literary Anecdotes of the
Eighteenth Century</cite>,’ by John Nichols, volume iv.
London, 1812, 8vo. page 552, and volume vi. part I.
page 402. I shall close this notice of these most ancient
views of London Bridge, by observing to you,
that there is a view and a ground-plan of it, with
measurements, engraved by Toms, on the second plate
in Hawksmoor’s work, already cited.</p>

<p>“Let me remark to you, however, Mr. Barbican, as
touching the Chapel which I have thus described to
you, that the custom of erecting Religious Houses on
Bridges, is certainly of great antiquity. A notable
instance of this kind was on the Bridge at Droitwich,
where the road passed through the Chapel and separated
the congregation from the reading-desk and
pulpit. Another famous Bridge Chapel is also to be
found erected over the River Calder, at Wakefield, in
the West Riding of Yorkshire; of which, a folding
view, by W. Lodge, is inserted in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ducatus Leodiensis</cite>’
of Ralph Thoresby, London, 1715, folio, sometimes
placed at page 164. This beautiful fane, you
know, was built by King Edward IV. in memory of
his father, Richard, Duke of York, who was killed in
the battle fought near Wakefield, on December the
31st, 1460. The Bridge Chapel, however, though
extremely rich in its architecture, was not so singular
as our’s at London, since it was not built <em>in</em> the pier,
and descending even to the water’s edge, but <em>upon</em> the
pier, and the platform of the Bridge itself. Somewhat
like our shrine of St. Thomas, however, as it belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to the poor of the town, it was, about 1779, converted
into a dwelling-house, and let at a small annual rent
to a retail dealer in old clothes! as that industrious
Antiquary, Richard Gough, tells us, in his ‘<cite>British
Topography</cite>,’ London, 1780, 4to. volume ii. page 437,
note, r. ‘To what base uses may we not return, Horatio!’
The edifice which had been erected for Monks
to chaunt forth their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Requiescats</i> in solemn procession;
the shrine which had been endowed for the sweet repose
of a warrior’s soul; the&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Mr. Barnaby Postern,” said I,
starting up, “you’ll contribute to <em>my</em> sweet repose,
unless you leave wandering in Yorkshire, and return
again to London Bridge: what have we to do with a
bead-roll of all the Bridge Chapels that are scattered
through England? I desire to know but of one; for,
by its having existed, we are sure that there might
have been some sort of custom for their erection; and,
as old Chaucer saith,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Experience, though none auctoritye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were in this world, is quite enough for me.’”</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div>
<p>“True, Sir, true,” said the mild old Antiquary;
“you have once more brought me back to my starting-post;
for I own that I am too apt, when discoursing
upon one subject, to branch out into others which
seem to illustrate, or are in any degree connected with
it. You will, however, I dare say, allow me to remark,
that Plutarch denies the derivation of the word Pontifex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from the old Roman custom of sacrificing on
Bridges, which might, nevertheless, be the origin of
Chapels being built upon them. He mentions this in
his Life of Numa Pompilius, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vit&aelig; Parallel&aelig;</cite>,’
best edition, by Augustine Bryan, and M. du Soul,
London, 1729-24, 4to. volume i. page 142. The Greek
passage begins, ‘<span lang="el" title="Nouma de kai t&ecirc;n t&ocirc;n archiere&ocirc;n">Νουμᾷ δὲ και τὴν των αρχιερεων</span>,’ &amp;c., and
the Latin, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jam etiam sacerdotum</i>;’ but I shall give
you the excellent modern English version of Dr.
Langhorne, in his very popular translation of the
old Classic, from the edition of Mr. Archdeacon
Wrangham, London, 1813, 8vo. volume i. pages 181,
182: ‘To Numa,’ says the passage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> ‘is attributed
the institution of that high order of priests, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontifices</i>; over which, he is said to have presided
himself. Some say, they were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontifices</i>, as
employed in the service of those powerful gods that
govern the world; for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potens</i>, in the Roman language,
signifies powerful. Others, that they were ordered
by their law-giver to perform such offices as were in
their power, and standing excused when there was
some great impediment. But most writers assign a
ridiculous reason for the term, as if they were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontifices</i>, from their offering sacrifices upon the
Bridge, which the Latins call <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontem</i>; such kinds of
ceremonies, it seems, being looked upon as the most
sacred, and of the highest antiquity. These Priests,
too, are said to have been commissioned to keep the
Bridges in repair, as one of the most indispensable
parts of their sacred office.’ Plutarchus, the author
of this, you remember, died about A. D. 140; and
the period of which he wrote, was about 630 years
before the birth of Christ. That giant of learning,
also, John Jacob Hoffmann, denies that the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontifex</i> had any thing to do with a Bridge; as you
may see discussed at considerable length, in his
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lexicon Universale</cite>,’ Leyden, 1698, folio, volume iii.
page 836, column 2, where he says, it is compounded
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere</i>, that is to say, such persons as are
<em>able to do</em> the thing, or sacrifice: but as the article is
equally long, erudite, and curious, I refer you to the
original.</p>

<p>“And now we come to speak of Stow’s singular
hypothesis, that the River Thames was turned in its
current, during the erection of the first Stone Bridge
at London. He states this in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.
page 58, where he also says, that the course of the
stream was carried through ‘a trench cast for that
purpose; beginning, as it is supposed, East about
Rotherhithe, and ending in the West about Patricksey,
now termed Battersey.’ Strype, the last, and, perhaps,
the best Editor of our old Metropolitan Historian, on
the page above cited, seems inclined to support this
idea; for he says, ‘It is much controverted whether
the River Thames was turned, when the Bridge over
it was built, and whether the River was more subject
to overflow its banks anciently than at present; and
from all that hath been seen and written upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
turning of the River, it seems very evident to me, that
it <em>was</em> turned while the Bridge was building, and that
it is more subject to overflow its banks now, than it
was formerly; for the channel of the River must have
been deeper than it is now, or the Palace of Westminster
would never have been built where the Hall
and the rest of its remains are now situated. Is it to
be supposed that any Prince would have built a Palace,
where the lower rooms were liable to be overflowed at
a spring-tide, as we see the Hall has been several
times of late years, and the lawyers brought out on
porters’ backs? The reason whereof is, that the sands
have raised the channel, and, consequently, the tides
must rise higher in proportion, than they did formerly;
and unless some care is taken to cleanse the River, the
buildings on the same level with the floor of Westminster-Hall,
will not be habitable much longer, as
the sand and ouse are still daily increasing, and
choking up the bed of the River.’ Nicholas Hawksmoor,
also, on page 8 of his work, which I have already
quoted, says, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> ‘many skilful persons have thought
that the River Thames was not turned, but that the
flowing of the tides was then different, and that the
water did not rise so high at the Bridge; for the
Thames might heretofore overflow the marshes near
the sea, and have a greater spreading; which being
now restrained by the bank, called the wall of the
Thames, into narrower limits, and the water which
comes from the sea into the mouth of the Thames
during the flood, not being received by the marshes,
must come up into the country, and so swell the tide
higher at London than it usually did. The celebrated
Sir Christopher Wren was of opinion, that when the
foundation of London Bridge was laid, the course of
the River was <em>not</em> turned, but that every pier was set
upon piles of wood, which were drove as far as might
be under low-water mark, on which were laid planks
of timber, and upon them the foundation of the stone
piers: the heads of the said piles have been seen at a
very low ebb, and may be so still when some of the
chalk or stone is removed to mend the Sterlings.’</p>

<p>“Maitland, and his Editor Entick, are also both
opposed to the idea that the River was turned during
the erection of London Bridge, as they evince on page
46 of their ‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>;’ where they ground their objections
to it on the following arguments. Firstly, it is
supposed that the vestiges of Knute’s Canal&mdash;which, as
we have seen, took the same course as Stow supposes
the River to have taken,&mdash;might have deceived him;
a reason also adopted by Hawksmoor, in the place I
last cited. Secondly, the charge of such an immense
work is next objected to; as the cost of the ground
intended for the trench, the embankment of it, and
the damming off the River itself, must have amounted
to at least treble the sum which would otherwise have
been required to erect the Bridge. The total silence
of those Historians who mention the construction of
London Bridge, upon the subject of so great a work
as the turning of the River, is next insisted upon:
and, finally, the length of time which the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
occupied,&mdash;thirty-three years,&mdash;is adduced as alone
sufficient to overthrow the whole hypothesis. ‘For,’
adds the author, ‘had the people concerned in erecting
it, had dry ground to have built upon, it might have
been finished in a tenth part of the time, and in a much
more durable manner.’ Maitland then proceeds to
state, that, in 1730, he surveyed the Bridge, in company
with Mr. Bartholomew Sparruck, the Water-Carpenter
of the same; and that he observed in many
places,&mdash;where the stones were washed from the sterlings,&mdash;the
mighty frames of piles whereon the stone
piers or pillars were founded; the exterior parts of
which, consisted of huge piles driven as closely together
as art could effect. ‘On the tops of these,’ he
continues, ‘are laid long planks, or beams of timber,
of the thickness of ten inches, strongly bolted; whereon
is placed the base of the stone pier, nine feet above the
bed of the River, and three below the sterlings; and
on the outside of this wooden foundation,&mdash;and for
its preservation,&mdash;are drove the piles called the sterlings.’
He then goes on to observe, that Mr. Sparruck
informed him, that he and the Bridge-Mason had frequently
taken out of the lowermost layers of stones in
the piers, several of the original stones, which were
laid in pitch instead of mortar; and that from this circumstance
they imagined, that all the outside stones
of the piers, as high as the sterlings, were originally
bedded in the same material, to prevent the water
from damaging the work. This labour was, he thinks,
continued at every ebb tide, until the piers were raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
above high-water mark; and hence he argues, that if
the Thames had been turned, there would not have
been any occasion for the use of pitch, and that
Plaster of Paris was not then in use in this country.
These are the principal heads of the dispute concerning
the turning of the River: to which I only
add my own settled conviction, that <em>the course of the
Thames was not altered</em>.”</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“But pray, my worthy friend,” said I, as he concluded,
“what other buildings stood upon the Bridge
built by Peter of Colechurch, besides the Chapel of
St. Thomas?”</p>

<p>“That is a point,” replied he, “upon which Antiquaries
are very far from being decided: for whilst
some assert, with Sir Joseph Ayloffe in his account of
the Bridge attached to Vertue’s prints, that, at first,
there were no houses upon it, and that it was only
plainly coped with stone until 1395,&mdash;late in the
reign of Richard II.,&mdash;others argue that it was built
upon to some extent two centuries before, and, indeed,
there is proof of this being the case in the reign of
King Edward I., as I shall shew you anon. Stow,
in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i. page 22, says that the
Bridge Gate, which was erected at the Southwark
end, was one of the four first and principal gates of
the City, and stood there long before the Conquest,
when there was only a Bridge of timber, being the
seventh and last mentioned by Fitz-Stephen. Maitland,
at page 30 of his first volume, when he comes
to speak of the same erection, denies not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
truth, but even the probability of Stow’s assertions;
and, indeed, Stephanides himself says only at page 24,
‘On the West,’&mdash;that is of London,&mdash;‘are two Castles
well fortified; and the City wall is both high and
thick with seven double gates, and many towers on the
North side, placed at proper distances. London once
had its walls and towers in like manner on the South,
but that vast River, the Thames, which abounds with
fish, enjoys the benefit of tides, and washes the City on
this side, hath, in a long tract of time, totally subverted
and carried away the walls in this part.’ The Latin of
this passage commences at ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ab Occidente duo Castella
munitissima</i>,’ &amp;c. Maitland then goes on to argue,
that Fitz-Stephen could have no regard to a gate on
the South, there being no wall remaining; ‘whereas,’
says he, ‘on the contrary, it is manifest that his seven
gates were in the continued wall on the land side.’</p>

<p>“It is probable, however, that, at a very early period
after its erection, towers were reared upon London
Bridge, for there was one standing at each end; but
of these I shall speak more largely under future
years: remarking only, that it is by no means impossible
for a Watch-tower and gate to have stood
upon the Bridge, even from its very first erection,
seeing that it was, as it were, a new key to the City.
A sort of Barbican, Mr. Geoffrey, such as you derive
your name from; for you remember the essential
importance which such buildings were of, and how
Bagford speaks of them in his Letter to Hearne,
which I have already quoted, page lxii. ‘Here,’ says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he, ‘they kept Cohorts of Souldiers in continual
service’&mdash;for your Barbican Tower was of Roman invention,&mdash;‘to
watch in the night; that if any sudden
fire should happen, they might be in a readiness to
extinguish it, as also to give notice if an enemy were
gathering or marching towards the City to surprise
them. In short, it was a Watch-tower by day; and at
night, they lighted some combustible material on the
top thereof, to give directions to the weary traveller
repairing to the City, either with provision or on
some other occasion.’</p>

<p>“But to pass from probabilities to certainties, let
us now, having got the Bridge fairly built of stone,
consider the many events and changes which it hath
experienced, from its infancy in the thirteenth Century,
to its old age in the nineteenth: and so, my
excellent auditor, Here begin the Books of the
Chronicles of London Bridge.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“That sorrowful exclamation, ‘No sooner born
than dead!’ may well, at the period at which we are
now arrived, be uttered over this scarcely completed
edifice; for in the night of the 10th of July, 1212,
within four years after its being finished, a dreadful
conflagration took place upon it. Stow, at page 60
of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ cites the Book of Dunmow, William
de Packington, and William of Coventry, as his authorities
for that excellent account of it which I shall
presently repeat to you. Let me, however, first
observe, that Packington was Secretary and Treasurer
to Edward the Black Prince, in Gascoigne, about 1380.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
For <em>William</em> of Coventry, I conceive that we should
read <em>Walter</em> of Coventry; because the former, who
wrote about 1360, is celebrated in page 148 of Bishop
Nicolson’s ‘<cite>Historical Libraries</cite>,’ already cited, as the
Author of a work ‘concerning the coming of the
Carmelites into England.’ Walter, on the contrary,
at page 61, is mentioned as having compiled three
books of Chronicles, about the year 1217, which yet
remain in Manuscript in Bennet College, Cambridge.
The ‘<cite>Chronicle of Dunmow</cite>,’ which is the other authority
quoted by Stow, is now to be found only in a
small quarto volume in the Harleian Library of Manuscripts,
No. 530, article ii. page 2&#8201;a. It consists of
a miscellaneous collection of notes, in the hand writings
of Stow, Camden, and perhaps Sir Henry Savile;
transcribed upon old, stained, and worn-out, paper.
The notice of this great fire is very brief, and, with
the heading of the extracts, runs thus: ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collectanea
ex Chronico de Dunmowe</cite>.’&mdash;‘1213. London was burned
and the Brydge also, and many peryshed by violence
of the fyre.’ Stow’s own account, however, is the
most interesting extant, and is as follows. ‘The
Borough of Southwark,’ says he, ‘upon the South
side of the River of Thames, as also the Church of
our Lady of the Canons there,’&mdash;that is to say the
Church of St. Mary Overies, which changed its name
upon being re-founded, in 1106, for Canons Regular,
by William de Pont de l’Arche, and William D’Auncy,
Norman knights,&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> ‘being on fire, and an exceeding
great multitude of people passing the Bridge,
either to extinguish and quench it, or else to gaze and
behold it; suddenly the North part, by blowing of
the South wind was also set on fire; and the people
which were even now passing the Bridge, perceiving
the same, would have returned, but were stopped by
the fire: and it came to pass, that as they stayed or
protracted the time, the other end of the Bridge also,
namely, the South end was fired; so that the people,
thronging themselves between the two fires, did nothing
else but expect present death. Then there came
to aid them many ships and vessels, into which the
multitude so unadvisedly rushed, that the ships being
thereby drowned, they all perished. It was said, that
through the fire and shipwreck, there were destroyed
above three thousand persons, whose bodies were found
in part or half burned, besides those that were wholly
burned to ashes, and could not be found.’</p>

<p>“Such is Stow’s account of this melancholy event,
which is best confirmed by the ‘<cite>Annals of Waverley</cite>,’
page 173; but they state also, that under this year,
‘1212, London, about the Bridge, was great part
burned, together with the Priory of Southwark.’ Now,
if we might credit the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Histori&aelig; Angli&aelig;</cite>’ of that wily,
but elegant Italian, Polydore Vergil, we might be sure,
that even at this period, London Bridge was built
upon: ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ipso illo anno</i>,’ says he, at page 276 of his book,
setting out, however, with an erroneous date, ‘In that
same year’&mdash;1211,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>‘all the buildings that were erected
upon London Bridge, were, even upon both sides,
destroyed by fire: the which is esteemed a place of
wonder.’ Polydore Vergil, you know, was an Historian
of the reign of King Henry VIII. so we shall
refer to him hereafter; and his work, now cited, was
written at that Monarch’s request, so late as about
the year 1521. It is esteemed chiefly for its elegant
diction; and the best edition of it is considered to
be that printed at Leyden, in 1651, octavo; though
the foregoing reference is to the last impression of
the Basil folio, A. D. 1570.</p>

<p>“There does not appear, however, to have been
any very effectual or speedy order taken for the restoration
of London Bridge; for in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Clausi</cite>,’
or the Close Rolls, of the 15th Year of King John,
1213, Membrane the 3rd, is the following entry.
‘It is commanded to the Mayor and Sheriffs of
London, that the halfpence which are now taken of
foreign Merchants, shall be given to the work of
London Bridge. Witness Myself at the Tower of
London, on the 18th day of December, in the 15th
year of our reign.’&mdash;You will find the Latin of this
printed in the second impression of Thomas Hearne’s
edition of the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger Scaccarii</cite>,’ London, 1771,
8vo. volume i. page *471; and the original record
may be seen in the Tower of London, written in so
small, delicate, and abbreviated a character, that it
hardly makes two lines on the narrow parchment
roll. And now that we are speaking of the repairs of
London Bridge, I should observe, that they are closely
connected with the history of the Bridge-House and
Yard in Tooley Street, Southwark; since Stow tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
you in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume ii. page 24, that they
were so called and appointed, as being ‘a storehouse
for stone, timber, or whatsoever pertaineth to the
buildings or repairing of London Bridge.’ He adds
too, that this House ‘seemeth to have taken beginning
with the first foundation of the Bridge either of
stone or timber;’ and that it is ‘a large plot of ground
on the bank of the River Thames, containing divers
large buildings for the stowage’ of materials for the
repairs of London Bridge. Of events which particularly
concern this place, I shall, however, speak
more fully in their proper order of time.</p>

<p>“In the year 1235, you will recollect that Isabel,
third daughter of King John, by his third Queen,
Isabella of Angoul&ecirc;me, was sent with great splendour
into Germany, to marry the Emperor Frederick II.
She was attended by William Brewer, Bishop of
Exeter, and a Privy Councillor to King Henry III.,
and also by the Archbishop of Cologne, the Imperial
proxy, who had pronounced her Empress. Upon
this occasion, according to the customs of the ancient
Norman Law and the Feudal System, the King received
an aid to furnish her dowry, of two marks
out of every Knight’s Fee;&mdash;that is to say, as it is
usually accepted, &pound;1. 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> from every person who
possessed an estate of &pound;20. per annum, which was
granted by the Common Council of the kingdom.
This rather uncommon aid, you find certified in
Thomas Madox’s ‘<cite>History and Antiquities of the
Exchequer of the Kings of England</cite>,’ London, 1711,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
folio, page 412; and in the voluminous collections of
that eminent Antiquary, now preserved with Sir
Hans Sloane’s Manuscripts in the British Museum,
No. 4563, page 181&#8201;b, is the following very curious
document, which connects this circumstance with the
history of London Bridge. ‘To be remembered concerning
the payments of Purprestures’&mdash;fines for enclosing
and damaging of Land&mdash;‘and of Escheats’&mdash;accidental
returns of estates to their principal owners,&mdash;‘It
is commanded to the Sheriffs, that they get all
the arrears of all the above rents, and the issues
of all Purprestures and Escheats; <em>excepting the rents
of London Bridge</em>, and the remainder of the amerciaments
belonging to the Circuit of W. of York,’&mdash;most
probably Walter Grey, then Archbishop of York,
and Lord Chancellor,&mdash;‘as well in the County of
Middlesex as at the Tower, and all the deficiencies
(of the aid) for marrying the King’s sister, and for
the passing over this sea into Gascony.’ In the Exchequer
Rolls of the 32nd of Henry III., A. D. 1247, 12&#8201;a.</p>

<p>“Towards the latter end of the year 1248, King
Henry vainly endeavoured to collect from his Barons,
a sum sufficient to enable him to recover certain provinces
in France; upon which, he offered a portion of
his plate and jewels for sale to the Citizens of London,
by whom they were bought. The King, displeased
at finding they readily procured money for such
a purpose, and yet pleaded poverty whenever he
solicited a supply, resolved upon retaliation; and, to
that end, kept his Christmas in the City, forced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
inhabitants to present him with divers costly New
Year’s gifts, and established a Market at Westminster,
to last for fifteen days, beginning on the 13th of October,
during which time all other fairs were suspended,
and, in London itself, all commerce was
prohibited. I think too, that we may trace the effects
of Henry’s anger yet farther; for, in the Patent Roll
of the 34th year of his reign, 1249, Membrane the
5th, is the following writ.</p>

<p>“‘Of taking the City of London into the hands of
our Lord the King. The King, &amp;c. to his faithful
W. de Haverhull, his Treasurer; Peter Blund, Constable
of the Tower of London; and Ernald Gerandin,
his Chamberlain: Greeting. We command that without
delay, you take into your hands our City of
London, with the County of Middlesex, and London
Bridge in like manner: so that the issues of the
same be answered for to us at our Exchequer at our
pleasure. And all the aforesaid shall be in safe custody,
until the receipt of another mandate from us.
In testimony of which thing, etc&aelig;tera, Witness the
King at Merton, on the 20th day of May.’ The original
of this is of course in the Tower.</p>

<p>“In the same National depository of invaluable
records, Mr. Geoffrey, there is, in the Patent Rolls of
the 37th of Henry III.&mdash;1252,&mdash;Membrane the 4th,
an entry entitled ‘A Protection for the Brethren of
London Bridge, concerning the charitable gifts collected
for the reparation of the said Bridge.’ This,
like the foregoing instrument, has not, as I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
remember, ever been printed; and, translated into
English, it is as follows. ‘The King to the Archbishops,
&amp;c. Greeting. Know ye that we engage for
the protection and defence of our Brethren of London
Bridge, and their men, lands, goods, rents, and all
their possessions. And therefore we command, that
they, the Brethren, and their men, lands, goods, rents,
and all possessions, in their hands, ye should hold protected
and defended. Nor shall any bring upon them,
or permit to be brought upon them, any injury, molestation,
damage, or grievance. And if it be that any
thing hath been forfeited by them, amendment shall
be made without delay. And we also desire of you,
that when the aforesaid Brethren, or their Messengers,
shall come to you for your alms for their support, or
for that of the aforesaid Bridge, ye shall courteously
receive them, and cause them to be so received in all
your Churches, Towns, and Courts; and that ye will
bestow upon them of your goods according to your
charity and the sight of our precept, the alms which
they desire. So that in reward thereof ye may be
worthy of all the blessings of mercy, and our special
thanks shall be due unto you. In testimony of which
thing, &amp;c. Witness the King at Portsmouth, the
fifteenth day of July.’</p>

<p>“Really,” said I to Mr. Postern, as he concluded
the last Charter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> “your memory, Mr. Barnaby, is
little less than miraculous! Why, it must be like
a chain cable, to hold together the contents of all
these musty Patent Rolls, with their endless repetitions.
I myself am called by my intimates, ‘<em>Memory
Barbican</em>,’ and I can recollect events and stories indifferently
well; but <em>you!</em> you remind me of the
Wandering Jew, who has lived eighteen hundred years,
and never forgot any thing in his life!”</p>

<p>“Ah! my good Sir,” answered the Historian of
London Bridge, “if my memory were equal to your
praise of it, it were, indeed, worth boasting of; but
in my broken narrative I can shew you but here and
there an isolated fact, whilst to the greater part of
the story, we are obliged to say with <em>Master Shallow</em>,
‘Barren! Barren! Beggars all! Beggars all!’”</p>

<p>“Take a draught out of the fragment of Master
Shallow’s fat friend here,” returned I, pointing to the
Sack Tankard, “and set out afresh, my old kinsman;
but pray let us have the spur on the other leg now,
and give us a little History to lighten our Law; with
which request,&mdash;Here’s my service to you!” Mr.
Postern bowed as I drank, and after having followed
my example, thus continued.</p>

<p>“You must doubtless remember, my good Sir,
that during those unhappy Baronial wars which lasted
nearly the whole of the extended reign of Henry III.
it was supposed that Queen Eleanor of Provence
opposed the Sovereign’s agreeing to the Barons’ demands;
and that in revenge for this, how very uncivilly
the Citizens treated her at London Bridge.
Matthew of Westminster tells the story under the
year 1263, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flores Historiarum</cite>.’ London, 1570,
folio, Part ii. page 315; and he, as you will recollect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was a Benedictine Monk of Westminster, who
flourished, as Bishop Nicholson supposes in his ‘<cite>Historical
Libraries</cite>,’ page 66, about the year 1307, when
his history ends. The event to which I allude was,
that as the Queen was going by water to Windsor,
just as her barge was preparing to shoot the Bridge,
the populace intercepted her progress, attacked her
with vehement exclamations and reproaches, and endeavoured
to sink her vessel, and deprive her of life
by casting heavy stones and mud into her boat. Upon
this, she was compelled to return to the Tower, where
the King had garrisoned himself, as the City had declared
for the Barons, whence she was removed to the
Bishop of London’s Palace, at St. Paul’s. It was in
the latter end of the same year, that Simon de Montfort,
the sturdy Earl of Leicester, and the Baronial
leader, marched his forces through the County of
Surrey towards London, in the hope that his friends,
Thomas Fitz-Richard, then Lord Mayor, Thomas de
Pynlesdon, Matthew Bukerel, and Michael Tony,
with whom was connected an immense multitude of
the common rabble, would open the Bridge Gates to
him. When the King, however, became acquainted
with the Earl’s design, he left the Tower, and encamped
with his troops about Southwark, to oppose
his passage. As the Earl of Leicester relied more
upon the assistance of the Citizens, than on the valour
of his own soldiers, he vigorously attacked the King’s
troops, expecting that the Londoners would favour
his entrance. Henry, however, had still several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
adherents in the City; and, indeed, Thomas Wikes,
in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronicon</cite>,’ page 58, as it is printed in
volume ii. of Gale’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scriptores</cite>,’ already cited, tells us
that the Baronial party in London was composed of the
meanest and most worthless, whom the wisest and
eldest endeavoured to controul. During the fight,
therefore, some of the Royalists, and especially one
John Gisors, a Norman, perceiving that the City was
in motion to assist De Montfort, locked up the Bridge
Gates, and threw the keys into the Thames. So
prompt an action had nearly proved fatal to the Earl
of Leicester, who had approached the Bridge with
only a few soldiers, lest his designs should be discovered;
but at length the Gates were broken open,
the Citizens rushed out in multitudes to his rescue;
King Henry was obliged to retreat, and De Montfort
entered the City. By this event we are informed that
there certainly <em>did</em> exist a Bridge Gate in the year
1264; and the historians by whom the fact is related,
are Matthew of Westminster, whose ‘<cite>Flowers of Histories</cite>’
I have already quoted, of which book, see
page 317; and the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronicon</cite>’ of Thomas Wikes,
a Canon Regular of Osney, near Oxford, which concludes
with the year 1304.</p>

<p>“It would seem almost certain that, at this period,
the keeping of London Bridge, with all its emoluments,
was in the possession of the Brethren of St.
Thomas of the Bridge; and the idea is somewhat
supported by the Protection to which I referred you
but a short time since. There is, however, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Patent Rolls preserved in the Tower of London, of
the 50th of Henry III.&mdash;1265,&mdash;Membrane the 43rd,
the following instrument.</p>

<p>“‘For the Hospital of St. Catherine, concerning the
Custody of London Bridge, with all the rents thereof
for the space of five years.</p>

<p>‘The King to the Brethren and Chaplains ministring
in the Chapel of St. Thomas upon London
Bridge, the other inhabitants upon the same Bridge;
and to all others to whom these letters shall come,
Greeting: Know ye, that we commit unto the Master
and Brethren of the Hospital of Saint Catherine near
to our Tower of London, the Custody of the aforesaid
Bridge with all its appurtenances, as well the
rents and tenements thereof, as of others which
belong to the aforesaid Bridge, within and without
the City: to have and to hold by the said Master and
Brethren for the space of five years. Yet so that out
of the aforesaid rents, tenements, and other goods of
the aforesaid Bridge, the repair and support of the
Bridge is to be looked for, and to be done, from
henceforth from that place as it shall be able, and as
it hath been accustomed. And therefore we command
you, that to the said Master and Brethren, as well as
to the keepers of the aforesaid Bridge, all things belonging
to that custody be applied, permitted, and
paid, until the term aforesaid. Witness the King at
Westminster, on the sixteenth day of November.’
The Latin of this writ you find printed in Hearne’s
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger</cite>,’ which I have before quoted, volume i.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
page *471; and it affords us certain proof of the early
existence of dwellings on London Bridge.</p>

<p>“I will but remark in passing onwards, that
Madox, in his ‘<cite>History of the Exchequer</cite>,’ already
cited, page 534, quotes a Roll to shew that in the 52nd
year of King Henry III.&mdash;1267,&mdash;Walter Harvey,
and William de Durham, Bailiffs of the City of
London, accounted to the Crown for the sum of
&pound;7. 0<em>s.</em> 2&frac12;<em>d.</em> being the amount of the Custom of Fish
brought to London Bridge Street, and other Customs
also taken there. The term for which the Hospital of
St. Catherine was to enjoy the custody of London
Bridge, wanted, however, more than a whole twelvemonth
of its completion, when a new Patent was
issued by Henry III. in 1269, the 54th year of his
reign, granting it to his Queen Eleanor of Provence.
It is entitled, ‘The King gives to Eleanor, Queen of
England, the custody of London Bridge, with the
liberties;’ and you will find it the third article on
the 4th Membrane, in the Patent Roll for the above
year: the Latin is printed by Hearne in the place
which I last cited, page *472, and the writ in English
is as follows:”</p>

<p>“‘The King to all etc&aelig;tera, Greeting. Seeing
that some time since we would have granted to our
most dear Consort Eleanor, Queen of England, the
Custody of our Bridge at London, with the liberties
and all other things belonging to that Bridge, to have
for a certain term: We, therefore, do grant to the same
Queen, out of our abundant grace and will, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
custody of the Bridge aforesaid, with the liberties and
all other things belonging to that Bridge, to be considered
from the Feast of All Saints,’&mdash;1st of November&mdash;‘about
to arrive; and from the same Feast
of All Saints, until the full end of the six years next
approaching, and following. In testimony of which
thing, etc&aelig;tera, Witness the King, at Woodstock, on
the 10th day of September.’”</p>

<p>“And pray, Mr. Barnaby Postern,” said I, in a
drowsy kind of voice, for I was almost tired at sitting
so long silent, “did the Queen enjoy the whole of her
term, or was the custody of London Bridge again
otherwise disposed of?”</p>

<p>“You bring me, worthy Mr. Geoffrey,” answered
he, “by your very seasonable question, to speak of
a matter in which the Citizens of London obtained a
great triumph on behalf of their Bridge. It is somewhat
singular, that Stow, at page 60 of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i. has very hastily, and, in my poor mind, very
imperfectly, related this matter; whilst Maitland, on
page 48 of his ‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ volume i. has told it still
less circumstantially. I shall therefore, my good
friend, take the freedom to put the proceedings between
the Queen and the Citizens in somewhat more
particular a form, illustrating them by the very
records from whence we derive our information; for
to these let me say, that neither of the authors whom
I have mentioned give you any reference. Previously
to commencing, however, I must entreat you
to bear with me, Mr. Barbican, if my proofs cited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
from the ancient Rolls of the Kingdom be dull and
formal; and to remember that they are often the
only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fragmenta</i> we possess of past events. Tracing of
local history is like endeavouring to follow the course
of a dried-up river: a rude channel here and there
presents itself; some mouldering ruin, once the abutment
of an ancient Bridge, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Postern,” said I, taking up the Tankard, and
interrupting him, “once more, here’s your health, and
I wish you safe out of your wilderness: keep to one
thing at a time, man, leave your dried-up river, and
‘turn again Barnaby,’ to the dispute between Queen
Eleanor of Provence, and the Citizens of London,
concerning yonder Bridge.”</p>

<p>“In good time,” continued my visitor, “you have
brought me back again. And now, I would first
request you to remember, that King Henry III.
died at London, on the 16th of November, 1272;
Prince Edward his son then being in the Crusade
in Palestine; whence, however, he returned to
England in July, or August, 1274. Now, almost
the whole of the reign of Henry III. had been disturbed
by the truculent Barons contending with him
for the final settlement of Magna Charta; and these
Civil Wars had very naturally produced numerous
abuses with respect to the Estates of England, such
as the Nobility assuming almost regal rights, imposing
heavy tolls, and the officers of the Crown using
divers exactions under colour of the law. Such was
the state of English affairs at the return of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Edward I., and it was one of the first acts of his
reign&mdash;as the ‘<cite>Annals of Waverley</cite>’ tell us on
page 235,&mdash;to enquire into the state of the revenues,
privileges, and lands of the Crown; as well as to examine
into the conduct of the sheriffs and officers, who
had at once defrauded the Sovereign and oppressed
his subjects. For this purpose, as the next circuit of
the Justices Itinerant was not expected for six years
then to come,&mdash;as they generally travelled it but
once in seven,&mdash;the King issued his Letters Patent
under the Great Seal, dated from the Tower of London,
on the 11th of October, 1274, appointing Commissioners
for each County in England, to make this important
inquisition. They were instructed to summon
Juries to enquire on oath the answers to thirty-five
Articles, examining into the King’s rights, royalties,
and prerogatives, and into the extent of all frauds
and abuses; the most full and ample instructions
being given them for their conduct. The returns and
answers to these enquiries constitute that interesting
body of Records denominated the ‘<cite>Hundred Rolls</cite>,’
which are preserved in the Wakefield Tower, in the
Tower of London: though, before we make any
references to these, let me remark, that you will find
their history, nature, and extent, fully described in
the ‘<cite>Reports from the Select Committee, appointed to
enquire into the State of the Public Records</cite>,’ 1801, folio,
pages 54, 57-62; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Hundredorum Tempore
Henrici III. et Edwardi I. in Turri Londinensi, et
in Curi&acirc; recept&aelig; Scaccarii Westmonasteriensi, asservati</cite>.’
London, 1812-18, 2 volumes, folio. The
original Patent Commissions, and Articles of Enquiry,
are also still preserved in the Patent Rolls in
the Tower, of the 2nd of Edward I., Membrane the
5th: by which we are informed, that Bartholomew
de Bryaunton, and James de Saint Victoire, were appointed
Inquisitors for the Counties of Kent, Surrey,
Sussex, and Middlesex, and for the City of London:
and that their enquiries for the latter place commenced
in the 3rd year of King Edward I., 1274-75.
On the first Membrane of the Roll for London it is
stated, that twelve Jurors of Basinghall, or as it is
often called Bassishaw Ward, gave the following
evidence concerning London Bridge, for the original
Latin of which see the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Hundredorum</cite>,’ which
I have already quoted, volume i. page 403, column 1.</p>

<p>“‘When they enquired concerning the Rents of the
Citizens and Burgesses, &amp;c.&mdash;They said that the custody
of London Bridge, which is wont to belong only
to the City, is alienated by the Lady Queen, Mother
of Edward our King; and the Keepers of the said
Bridge appointed by the same Lady Queen, expend
but little in the amending and sustaining of the said
Bridge. Whence danger may easily arise, very much
to the damage of the King and of the City.’ This is
the second Inquisition quoted by Stow, on page 60.
On the third Membrane of this same Roll, containing
the inquisition made in the Ward of William de
Hadestok, or Tower Ward, the Jurors said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> ‘the
Lady Queen Eleanor, Mother of our Lord the King,
is now possessed of the Bridge of London, who keeps
it badly, and that it was belonging to the City of
London:’ and also that the custody had been alienated
‘from the Battle of Evesham,’ August the 4th, 1265,
as I have already shewn you, until the time of the
inquisition. See page 405, column 1, of the ‘<cite>Hundred
Rolls</cite>’ before cited.</p>

<p>“The Jurors of the Ward of Fori, or Fore-street,
page 406, column 2 of the same book, and Membrane
4 of the original Roll, ‘said that London Bridge
had been for a long time in the hands of the City and
Citizens of London, and that such had been always
accustomed by general consent, to be made keepers of
the common Bridge of our Lord the King, and of his
City, and of all passers over it; and now,’ they continued,
‘the aforesaid Bridge is in the hands of the
Lady the Queen, and they know not by what warrant.
They said also, that the same Bridge is greatly and
perilously decayed through defect of keeping, which
is to the great peril of our Lord the King and his
City, and all passing over it.’ The evidence of the
Jurors of the Ward of Walter le Poter, was to the
same effect: and you will find it on Membrane 5 of
the Roll, and on page 408, column 2, of the printed
copy. A similar reply was also returned from the
Ward of Peter Aunger, see Membrane 6, and page
410, column 1: from Coleman Street Ward, Membrane
7, page 412, column 1: and from the Ward
of John de Blakethorne, Membrane 9, page 414,
column 2; where, however, it is added, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> ‘the
Bridge of London, which was formerly in the custody
of the whole Commonalty to be repaired and re-edified,
is now under that of Brother Stephen de
Foleborn for the Queen Mother.’</p>

<p>“The verdict of the twelve Jurors of the Ward of
John Horn, also testifies the Queen’s possession of
London Bridge, see Membrane 11, and page 416,
column 2: but from Queenhithe Ward, or that of
Simon de Hadestok, Membrane 13, and page 419,
column 1, we learn that the Jurors ‘said that the
Lord King Henry took the Bridge of London into
his own hands, presently after the Battle of Evesham,
and delivered it into the hands of the Lady the
Queen, Mother of the Lord the King, who hath it
now; and that to the great detriment of the Bridge,
and the prejudice of all the people; it is also now
nearly in a falling state, through defect of support.’
On Membrane 14, and page 420, column 1, the Jurors
of the Ward of John de Northampton,&mdash;which is, by
the way, the first Inquisition, so vaguely referred to
by Stow, at page 60 of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’&mdash;depose to the
same effect; as do those of the Ward of Thomas de
Basing, Membrane 15, and page 421, column 1; the
latter adding only, that when the Bridge was held by
the City, it was delivered to two honest Citizens to
keep, saving the rents of their custody. The only
information we gain from the Jurors of the Ward of
Dowgate, Membrane 16, and page 422, column 2, is,
that Brother Stephen, Bishop of Waterford, was custodier
for Queen Eleanor, whilst their evidence on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the Bridge dilapidations is quite as full as that of
the other Wards.</p>

<p>“Such were the chief answers to the inquisitions
concerning London Bridge, in the reign of King
Edward I.; I say the chief, for there are yet several
others, which, for the most part, are but abridged
repetitions of those already cited. Indeed, they are
recorded upon a different Roll, which is kept in the
Chapter House, at West-Minster; and you may see
their contents in the printed copies of the ‘<cite>Hundred
Rolls</cite>’ to which I have so often referred you, volume i.
pages 425-432.”</p>

<p>“Well, Master Postern,” said I, when my narrator
came to this breathing place, “and how did King
Edward and his Commissioners act upon this evidence
against Queen Eleanor of Provence? Were they not
of the mind of <em>Dogberry</em> as it regarded the answers of
the Citizens; ‘’Fore God! they are both in a tale,’
seeing that nearly all of them swore alike?”</p>

<p>“I cannot, now,” answered Mr. Postern, “call to
mind any historical proof that the custody of London
Bridge was immediately restored to the Mayor and
Citizens, though Maitland states, at page 48 of his
‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ but without quoting any authority, that
the Citizens did not cease to prosecute their suit by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i>, until they regained their ancient rights
and privileges. Now the fact is, it is by no means
certain that there was any such suit ever commenced
as it concerned the Bridge; for the inquisition was
first commanded by the King, and the Citizens had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
only to answer concerning the ancient possession and
present state of their property, part of which they stated
had been alienated by the King to the Queen Mother,
adding also, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et nesciunt quo Warranto</i>,’ they knew
not by what warrant, or right. This, probably, was
the phrase which led Maitland astray; added to which,
he cites at page 104 the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i> Bag of the
3rd year of Edward I. No. 4, in the Exchequer, containing
the complaints of the Citizens concerning
levies unjustly made.</p>

<p>“It was, however, not the City of London only that
presented and complained of alterations in the Bridge
customs; for in Messrs. Manning and Bray’s ‘<cite>History
and Antiquities of Surrey</cite>,’ London, 1804-14, folio,
volume iii. page 548, there is the following entry.
‘At an Assize at Guildford, in Surrey, in the Octave
of St. Michael,’&mdash;that is to say within the eight days
succeeding the 29th of September,&mdash;‘in the 7th of
Edward I. 1278&mdash;79, before John de Reygate and
other Justices Itinerant. There came twelve for the
Burgesses of Southwark. They present that a certain
part of London Bridge, about the great gate of the
Bridge, with the houses and buildings standing on
that part, used to belong to the Burgh of the King,
of Southwark, where the King used to have of rents
of Assize,’&mdash;namely, fixed rents which could never be
increased,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>‘yearly 11<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>; and of the customs of
things there sold, 16<em>s.</em> and one halfpenny, till fourteen
years ago, in the time of King Henry III., when the
Mayor and City of London appropriated it to the
City:&mdash;the King to be consulted. Also they present
that the Keeper of London Bridge holds a messuage
which formerly belonged to Reginald de Colemille,
who then held the same in Chief,’ immediately from
the King, ‘by the rent of one penny farthing: and
that Milo le Mareschall holds in Chief of the King
two messuages which were formerly the property of
Godefride de Marberer, and Henry le Mareschall,
and pays yearly two pence halfpenny.’ The ‘<cite>Assize
Pleadings</cite>,’ or Rolls, containing these particulars, were
written in consequence of inquisitions into the damages
and alienations of the King’s property, during
the reign of King Henry III., as I have already remarked
with regard to the Hundred Rolls: the original
pleadings are preserved in the Tower of London,
and in the Court of the Receipt of the Exchequer, in
the Chapter House at Westminster. Such were the
ancient rents of the houses on London Bridge; to
which I may add, that a Fruiterer’s Shop, two yards
and a half and one thumb in length, and three yards
and two thumbs in depth, was let on a lease from the
Bridge-master, at a rental of twelve pence.</p>

<p>“We well know, Mr. Barbican, that in the olden
time, Bridges were applied to many purposes which
now seem altogether foreign to such edifices. The
celebrated Du Cange, you will recollect, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Glossarium
ad Scriptores Medi&aelig; et Infim&aelig; Latinitatis</cite>,’
Paris, 1733-36, folio, volume ii. page 67, tells us,
that Philip the Fair, King of France, ordained in
1304, that the public Exchange, or Bankers’ Money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Table for Paris, should be held upon the Great
Bridge there, between the Church of St. Leufred
and the Great Arch, as it was anciently accustomed
to be. You may remember, also, that Bridges were
once considered as Funeral Monuments, for Olaus
Wormius, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monumentum Danicorum</cite>,’ Hafnia,
1643, folio, page 523, when speaking of the Island of
Foesoe, observes, that there was erected a Bridge at
the costs of two or three persons, as well to preserve
their own names to posterity, as to commemorate that
of Jotheimnt who converted them to Christianity.
He adds also, that the word <em>Bru</em>, which is unquestionably
the most ancient etymon of the term Bridge,
signifies that coronal of stone with which the large
burial-places, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumuli</i>, in fields, were encircled.
With what great propriety then, did the blessed
Peter of Colechurch confide his fame to, and rest his
most excellent bones, in London Bridge!</p>

<p>“Such, then, being the purposes to which Bridges
were once appropriated, we are not to wonder that a
Market formerly existed upon that of London; although
the circumstance is marked only by the order for its
removal, which we find mentioned by Maitland in his
‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ volume i. page 104, in the following terms.
‘In the fifth year of this King’s reign,’ that is to say
Edward I. 1276,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>‘it was ordained, that there should
not be kept a Market on London Bridge, nor in any
other place, except those appointed for that purpose:
also that no person should go out of the City to
Southwark to buy cattle, or any wares which might
be bought in the City, under the penalty of the
forfeiture of the thing bought. This is the first Ordinance
of the Common Council we find on record,
concerning the regulation and appointment of Markets
in this City.’ The margin of Maitland’s work states
that he derived this information from the book entitled
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Albus</cite>,’ preserved in the Record Chamber
of the City of London, folio, 130&#8201;a. Now this same
White Book, which I imagine to have been so called
from its having once had a cover of cream-coloured
calf, was a most curious and elaborate work, compiled,
as it is supposed by Strype, by one J. Carpenter, who
was Town Clerk in the reign of Henry V., and a great
benefactor to the City. It is dated November 5th,
1419, in the Mayoralty of Master Richard Whyttington,
and the 7th year of the Reign of Henry V. and ‘it
contains laudable customs not written, wont to be observed
in the City, and other notable things worthy
of remembrance here and there scatteringly, not in
any order written.’ Some of these memoranda, as
the Latin Prologue to the volume sets forth, are short
indexes to the contents of other City Books, Rolls,
and Charters, which are cited by their names, or
marks; and in the 4th Book, folio 70&#8201;a, there is a
reference to another record marked A, page cxxx.,
concerning the market on London Bridge, which was
probably the occasion of Maitland’s marginal note, as
the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Albus Transcriptum</cite>,’ itself, has not in any
part of it a page numbered 130. The volume then,
in which this very ancient order of the Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Council is really contained, is a small folio of a moderate
thickness, cased in boards, covered with white
leather, having a coating of rough calf over it. The
outside is garnished with bosses and clasps, now black
with age; and in the centre, a metal border holds
down a piece of parchment, on which is written in
Latin the title of the volume, in a clear black letter,
guarded by a plate of horn: informing us that it
was begun in the 4th year of the reign of Edward I.
1275, and finished in his 22nd year, 1293. The
leaves are of parchment, with the contents written in
a small Court-hand in Latin; and on folio 130&#8201;a, is
this entry. ‘Also that no Market place shall be kept
upon London Bridge, nor in any other place excepting
the appointed stations.’ On the preceding
folio, namely 129&#8201;b, there is also this farther order
concerning the Bridge: ‘Item, that no regraters,’&mdash;that
is to say those who both bought and sold in the
same market or fair,&mdash;‘shall come from below London
Bridge, for the buying and preparing of bread in the
City; because the Bakers of Southwark are not permitted
by the statutes of our City, to come from
without the City.’ Before I quit these venerable
records of London, I must observe to you that they
contain an almost infinite number of very curious
memoranda concerning London Bridge, which would
occupy no trivial time, either to collect or relate;
since in the same ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Albus</cite>’ are numerous references
to such particulars, see ‘for a taste now,’ as
<em>Touchstone</em> saith, the articles entitled ‘Of the Customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the Bridge, Part I. folio xii. a;’&mdash;‘of the Fees’&mdash;of
Fish,&mdash;‘of the Bridge Bailiff, folio xii. b;’&mdash;‘concerning
the keeping, rent, and course, of the water
under the wall,’&mdash;Wall-brook;&mdash;‘of the cleansing of
Fleet-ditch, and of the Bridge of London, and the
roads about London,’ book iv. page 16&#8201;a; ‘That the
Quays and house of St. Botolph be built and repaired
by the keepers of the Bridge, volume E. folio cxxv.;’
and ‘Writ for the keepers of the Bridge against the
Parson of Wolchurchaw, concerning the stalls on the
same. Volume G. folio clviii.’ Such are a few of
the very many historical notices relating to London
Bridge, preserved in the Civic Records; ‘Books,’
says Strype, in the interesting Preface to his first
edition of Stow’s Survey, London, 1720, never afterwards
reprinted,&mdash;‘Books, that contain such a treasure,
as, notwithstanding what Mr. Stow, as well as others,
have extracted thence, and published, many other
things in vast variety still remain there unprinted,’
and, we may almost add, unknown. Alas! my good
Sir, can we wonder at the paucity of historical narrative,
when we reflect how often its very sources
are undiscovered? Too many of our topographers,
‘content to dwell in decencies for ever!’ flatter each
other, and copy each other’s errors; but how seldom
do we see one, who, diving deeply into the broad
stream of Antiquarian lore, brings up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Postern,” said I, with some warmth, “this
is actually intolerable; there is really nothing but what
serves you for a Jack o’lanthorn to go astray by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Whether it be a book, or a bit of musty morality,
which has nothing at all to do with the matter, away
go you over hedges and ditches, and through a thousand
thickets and sloughs, rather than keep the
straight road; and dragging me along with you, over
the boots in mire. I think, on the whole, indeed, that
my estate is gracious that you have not <em>all</em> the Bridge
Records at command, for then should I be overwhelmed,
and <em>you</em> be ten times more wearisome.
Come back then, my good Sir; do pray come back
again, and finish the reign of Edward I., as it was
connected with the history of London Bridge.”</p>

<p>“I own,” answered Mr. Postern, in his usual undisturbed
manner, “that your patience is somewhat
tried by these details; but ever remember, Mr. Barbican,
I pray you, that our ancient Charters, with
all their barbarisms and tautology, our old Latin
Chronicles, with all their monkish fables and rudeness,
our brief Patent Rolls, with all their dryness and
seeming want of interest,&mdash;ever remember that these
are the sure foundations on which all History is built.
Simple truth was, in general, the only aim of the first
Chroniclers, to which later ages have added grace
of style, vividness of description, and interest of
narrative, to adorn their antique fidelity and plainness.</p>

<p>“But to proceed.&mdash;We are not made acquainted,
Sir, with any particulars of the repairs which followed
these inquisitions concerning London Bridge;
but in the 9th year of King Edward I.&mdash;1280,&mdash;there
was the following Patent issued for its support: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
original of which is preserved with the other Patent
Rolls in the Wakefield Tower, in the Tower of London,
9th Edward I. Membrane 25-27; a copy of the
Latin is printed in Hearne’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger</cite>,’ which
I have already quoted, volume i. page *472; and
English translations are to be found in Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i. page 59; and Maitland’s ‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ volume i.
page 47. The words of the Patent were these.</p>

<p>“‘Concerning the Relief and Reparation of the
Bridge of London.</p>

<p>‘The King to all his Bailiffs, and his faithful
subjects, to whom, &amp;c.&mdash;these presents shall come,&mdash;Greeting.
It hath been lately represented unto us,
and it grieves us to see, that the Bridge of London is
in so ruinous a condition; to the repair of which
unless some speedy remedy be put, not only the
sudden fall of the Bridge, <em>but also the destruction of
innumerable people dwelling upon it, may suddenly be
feared</em>.’&mdash;I pray you to take notice of this expression,
my good Sir, because it is an undeniable proof
of the very early occupation of the platform of
London Bridge by residences.&mdash;‘And that the work,’
continues the Patent, ‘which may now be helped by
some before it fall, may, for want of a supply, come
to the expense of a damage not to be repaired;
Wherefore we, who are bound to take care of, and, by
all gentle means, to provide for both the public and
private good, and with affection specially to embrace
those whom we perceive to be in want of our assistance,
and to receive them under our Royal protection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
We command and require you, that when the keepers
of the said costly work of the Bridge aforesaid, or
their messengers, who are under our especial protection
and license, shall come to you to collect everywhere
throughout our realm aids for the said work from
pious devotion, you do admit them friendly through the
contemplation of God, in respect of Charity, and for
evidence of devotion in this behalf: not bringing on
them, nor permitting to be brought upon them, injuries,
molestations, damage, impediment, or grievance:
and if any damage be done them, that ye make
them amends without delay. And when ye shall be
required by the aforesaid keepers, or their messengers,
to help in the reparation of the aforesaid Bridge, ye
will cheerfully contribute somewhat of your goods
thereto, according to your abilities. And let each of
you endeavour to outrun the other in such memorable
works of Charity, for which ye must have merit with
God, and shall gain thanks of us. In testimony of
which thing, Witness the King, at Walsingham, on
the eighth day of January.</p>

<p>“‘And it is also commanded to the Archbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Rectors, and to all other
Ministers of the Holy Mother Church, to whom these
presents shall come, that when they, the keepers of
the costly work of the Bridge aforesaid, or their
messengers, who are under our especial protection and
license, shall come to you to gather supplies for the
said work, everywhere throughout your Dioceses,
Rectories, or other jurisdictions whatsoever, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
pious and devout, you do admit them from the
contemplation of God, the regard of Charity, and for
evidence of devotion in this matter. Admitting them
to excite the people by their pious persuasions, and
charitably to invoke the assistance of their alms for
the repair of the Bridge aforesaid. Not bringing
upon them,’&mdash;and so forth to the end, as before.</p>

<p>“And, because, says Stow, when he has finished
this instrument, ‘because these voluntary alms and
charitable benevolences were not like to bring in the
whole charge of the business, therefore the next
year, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr></i> the 10th of Edward I., Anno 1281, the
same King issued out other Letters Patents for taking
Customs of all commodities for the same in London,
and that for a certain term of years.’ These grants
are also in the Tower, and the first occurs in the
Patent Roll of the 10th of Edward I. Membrane the
18th; for you must remember that the earliest articles
are the highest in number on the Roll, which
counts from bottom to top, though the printed Calendar,
or Index, reverses this order. The Latin text
of King Edward’s Patent is in Hearne, as before,
page *474, and the translation of it is as follows.</p>

<p>“‘Concerning the Reparation of London Bridge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>‘The King to his Mayor of London, Greeting:
Because of the sudden ruin of the Bridge of London,
we command you to associate with you two or three
of the more discreet and worthier Citizens of the
City aforesaid, to take, until our Parliament after
Easter next approaching, in supply of the reparation
of the Bridge aforesaid, the Customs hereafter written;
namely, of every man crossing the water of Thames,
or going over the aforesaid Bridge of London upon
either side, one Farthing; both unto Southwark, and
from Southwark unto London, by reason of the deficiency
of repair of the Bridge aforesaid: Of every
Horseman so crossing the same, one penny; and for
every pack carried on a horse, so crossing over the
same, one halfpenny. But we command, in the mean
time, that not any thing be taken on the same on this
occasion, excepting for the supply of the repairs of
the Bridge aforesaid. In testimony of which, &amp;c.
Witness the King, at Cirencester, the Fourth day of
February.’</p>

<p>“Before the appearance of the new Patent confirming
the foregoing, there was, however, issued that
grant to which I have already shewn you that Maitland
has a reference; and which is to be found recorded
on the Roll of the same year as the preceding, Membrane
the 11th. Stow also refers to it; and Hearne, on
page *475, prints it in the original Latin; in English
it ran thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘That the Mayor and Commonalty of London
have power to rent three waste portions of land in
divers places in London for the support of London
Bridge.&mdash;The King to all to whom these presents
shall come. Whereas by the testimony of our beloved
and faithful Ralph de Hengham, and William
de Brumpton, and of others worthy of credit, we
have been informed, that it is not to our damage, nor
to the hurt of our City of London, if we grant unto
our beloved Henry le Waleys, the Mayor, and the
Commonalty of the same City, that those vacant
places adjoining the wall of the Church of Wolchurch,
on the Northern side of the Parish of Wolchurch;
and that the other waste places adjoining the
wall of the Churchyard of the Church of St. Paul,
on the Eastern side, between the Gate of St. Augustine,
and the Street of West-Cheap: of which
places one half lieth in the Parish of St. Augustine,
and the other half in the Parish of St. Michael, at the
Corn-Market; and that the other empty places adjoining
the wall of the aforesaid Burial-place of the
Church of St. Paul, on the Northern side, between
the great gate of the said Burial-place, over against
the aforesaid Church of St. Michael; also the other
gate in the same wall towards the West, over against
the narrow way of Ivy lane, that they may build
thereon, and rent them for the support of the Bridge
at London. We grant for us, and for our heirs, to
the aforesaid Henry, and the Commonalty, that the
places aforesaid may be built upon and rented for the
benefit of them, and of the same City, as they shall
see greater cause to expedite them: and they, the
said buildings and rents, are to be held of them and
of their heirs for ever, for the support of the aforesaid
Bridge, without occasion or impediment, of us
and of our heirs, our Justices and our Bailiffs whomsoever.
In testimony of which thing, Witness the
King, at Hartlebury, the 24th day of May.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>“And now I am to remind you, Mr. Barbican,
that the Parish Church of St. Mary Woolchurch
stood, until after the Fire of London, on that spot
of ground once occupied by the Stock’s Market, and
now by the Mansion-House; and a part of those waste
places, which adjoined to St. Paul’s Church Yard,
was situate on the Eastern side of that street which
we at present term Old ’Change, because of the
Royal Exchange for the receipt of coined bullion,
which was once kept there. The Street of West-Cheap,
mentioned in the foregoing grant, was our
modern Cheapside; and St. Austin’s Gate stood on
the Northern side of Watling-street, forming the
South-East end of Old ’Change. Stow tells us, in
volume i. of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ page 637, that in consequence
of the preceding license of Edward I. Henry
Walleis built one row of houses on the Eastern side
of Old ’Change, the profits of which belonged to
London Bridge. The other portion of those vacant
pieces of ground lay in the Parish of St. Michael <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
Bladum</i>, as the Latin original hath it, which is to
say St. Michael at the Corn, or, corruptly speaking,
St. Michael Quern, because there was formerly a
Corn-Market on the site of it; and its famous Church,
which was never rebuilt after the fire, stood, as Stow
tells you, page 684, where Newgate Street and Pater
Noster Row, ‘like two rivulets joining into one, fall into
Cheapside.’ These vacant spaces, therefore, that were
given to London Bridge were in Pater Noster Row;
the houses in which, says Stow, page 664, ‘from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
first North gate of St. Paul’s Church Yard, unto the
next gate, were first built without the wall of the
Church Yard, by Henry Walleis, Mayor, in the Year
1282. The rents of those houses go to the maintenance
of London Bridge.’ This estate, as the deed
informs us, lay over against, or to the South of, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venella</i>, that is to say the narrow Street or Way,
which, even in 1281, was called Ivy Lane.</p>

<p>“This year was, indeed, prolific in Royal Grants,
for the benefit of London Bridge; for, in support
of that gift of Customs to be taken upon it, which I
have already recited, King Edward also issued the
following instrument which stands on the Patent
Rolls of the 10th of his reign, Membrane the 9th:
You will find a copy of the Latin in Hearne, page
*476; and translations of it are in Stow, volume i.
page 59, and in Maitland, volume i. page 47.</p>

<p>“‘Concerning the Customs taken for the Repair of
London Bridge.</p>

<p>‘The King to his Mayor of London. When lately,
by reason of the sudden ruin of London Bridge, we
commanded you, that associating with you two or
three of the more discreet and loyal Citizens of the
aforesaid City, ye should take, until our Parliament
after Easter next past, in supply of the reparation of
the Bridge aforesaid, a certain Custom, as in those
Letters Patents which we have caused to be made
from that time to you, is more fully contained. We,
being willing that the taking of the said Customs be
continued longer, command you, that from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Feast of St. Margaret the Virgin, next coming,’&mdash;namely,
the 20th of July,&mdash;‘unto the end of the Three
Years next following completed, ye take the underwritten
Custom of the aforesaid Bridge. That is to
say, of every man on foot, bringing merchandise or
other saleable goods, and crossing the Bridge aforesaid,
and betaking himself to other parts, one
Farthing: of every Horseman, crossing that Bridge,
and betaking himself to other parts with merchandise
or other saleable things, as aforesaid, one Penny: of
every Pack carried on a horse, and passing over that
Bridge, one Halfpenny. Nor will we, in the mean
time, that any thing be there taken on this occasion,
but for the supply of the reparation of the said
Bridge. But the aforesaid term of Three Years
being completed, let the above-mentioned Custom
cease and become void. In testimony of which thing,
&amp;c. for the aforesaid term of Three Years, this may
last. Witness the King, at Chester, the Sixth day of
July.’</p>

<p>“It is, however, worthy of remark, Mr. Geoffrey,
before I pass downwards to another Year, that both
Stow, at page 60, and Maitland, page 47, speak of this
as the first Grant of Customs to London Bridge, and
allude to that which I before rehearsed, as the second;
when the months in which they were issued, are no less
distant than February and July, independent of the
direct reference which this latter deed has to the
commencement and terms of the former. The mistake
has probably arisen from the peculiarity of numbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the skins on the Patent Roll, counting from the
lowest end of it, which I have already mentioned to
you, since the first instrument is on the eighteenth
Membrane, and the latter on the ninth.</p>

<p>“My next notice of London Bridge is of a nature
far less happy than are these Patents for its support,
for the Christmas of 1281 proved a most fatal season
to it; since Stow, in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ edited by Edmund
Howes, London, 1631, folio, page 201, tells us, though
without mentioning his authority, that ‘from this
Christmas till the Purification of Our Lady, there
was such a frost and snow, as no man living could
remember the like; where-through, five arches of
London Bridge, and all Rochester Bridge, were borne
downe, and carried away with the streame; and
the like hapned to many bridges in England. And
not long after, men passed over the Thames betweene
Westminster and Lambeth, and likewise over
the River of Medway betweene Stroude and Rochester,
dry-shod. Fishes in ponds, and birds in woods,
died for want of food.’ It would appear as if this devastation
had not been very quickly repaired, for,
when added to the former ruinous state of the Bridge,
the complete demolition of more than a fourth part of
it, made it not only a very lamentable, but almost
hopeless undertaking. Then, too, the very recent repetitions
of grants for its repair and support, rendered
the same course nearly impracticable, though old Stow
tells us, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i. page 61, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> ‘in
the year 1289, the Bridge was so sore decayed for
want of reparations, that men were afraid to pass
thereon; and a subsidy was granted towards the
amendment thereof. Sir John Britain being Custos
of London, Anno 1289, a great collection, or gathering,
was made of all Archbishops, Bishops, and other
ecclesiastical persons, for the reparations of London
Bridge.’ Of the writs for such collections I have,
perhaps, already given you sufficient specimens.</p>

<p>“Several years now passed, unmarked in our
Bridge Annals but by the renewal of those various
tolls, of which, but a short time since, I related to you
the particulars; which circumstances not only too
fatally prove into how lamentable a state of decay our
venerated edifice had then fallen; but what is infinitely
worse, those repeated Royal grants and tolls as
plainly indicate the dearth of that public spirit, which
had erst lived in the glorious Peter of Colechurch.
I will but observe then, that Stow, at page 60 of his
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ and Maitland, who probably merely copied
him, at page 47 of his ‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ both record the
fact, that in the 27th and 30th Years of King
Edward I., namely in 1298 and 1301, the same tolls
and customs were continued for the repair of London
Bridge. You will find the former of these grants
entered on the Patent Roll for the proper year, in the
Tower, under the title of ‘<cite>Pontage for London</cite>,’
Membrane 29; but as the instrument is of some considerable
length, I shall prefer giving you a similar
shorter one hereafter, being the last Pontage Patent
issued by that King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Barbican, we come to speak of a
new matter connected with London Bridge, and a singularly
curious one it is, inasmuch as it shews the
great antiquity and power of the Bridge Master; but
for the better illustration of it, have patience with me,
I pray you, for a few moments, whilst I recall to
your memory a point of legal history to which it is
collaterally related. In the times of our Saxon ancestors,
you may recollect one superior Court of Judicature,
called the <em>Wittenagemote</em>, or General Council
of Wise Men, was sufficient for the whole Kingdom.
When William I., however, came to be Sovereign,
he contrived to separate from it the Ecclesiastical
and Judicial authority, by establishing a new and
permanent Court in his own Palace, called in history
by the various names of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</i>, the King’s
Court, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aula Regia</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aula Regis</i>, the King’s
Hall. This was divided into several different departments,
the principal of which were composed
of the King’s great Officers of State, who were resident
in his Palace. Thus, the Lord Marshal generally
presided in affairs relating to honour and arms,
and the military and national laws; the Lord Chancellor
kept the King’s Seal, and had cognizance of all
instruments to which it was attached; the Lord
Treasurer was the chief authority in all matters concerning
the Revenue; and certain persons well acquainted
with the Laws, called the King’s Justices,
assisted by the Greater Barons of Parliament, formed
a Court of Appeal in difficult cases, over which presided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the Chief Justiciary of all England. For
a considerable time this universal Court was bound to
follow the King’s household in all its progresses and
expeditions, to the great delay of equity, and the
extreme trouble of the people; so that in the articles
of petition, which preceded the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Charta</cite>’ of
King John, Section 8, it was solicited that Common
Pleas, or causes, should no longer follow the King’s
Court, but be held in some certain and permanent place.
This article was one to which John consented more
readily than to any other in his Great Charter, as the
power of the Chief Justiciary being already very considerable,
he readily confirmed it by Chapter xvii.
of his grant. This officer’s place, however, was even
then but little altered, as he remained in Westminster
Hall, where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</i> had originally sat; and
in the same building a Court of Common Pleas was
established, for the determination of all causes concerning
land, and injuries between subject and subject.
The other departments of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aula Regia</i>, naturally
beginning to decline, soon after this separation, King
Edward I. then new modelled the whole judicial polity
of England, by dividing it into other Courts.</p>

<p>“Now, Sir, my intention in bringing to your memory
these historical memoranda, is, to remind you
that abstracts of written proceedings of these Courts,
sometimes called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placita Rolls</i>, or Rolls of Pleas,
are yet preserved, recorded in Law Latin in a current
Court-Hand full of contractions, some being in the
Tower of London, and others in the Chapter House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
at Westminster. These Rolls contain pleadings as
well made in the ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</i>, as in the Courts
subsequently erected; though, those of the reigns of
the First and Second Edwards are chiefly of pleas
in the King’s Bench, which is the last fragment of
the King’s Hall, because it <em>may</em> be removed with the
Sovereign’s person, wherever he goes; and, although
he be not actually present, yet he is still supposed to
be so, since the style of the court is yet ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coram ipso
Rege</i>,’ before the King himself. Now, a collection
of abstracts from the Placita Rolls of the various
Courts, having been made, and the contents being
thus of a very miscellaneous character as to their
original time and place, it has been printed by order
of the Commissioners of Records under the title of
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placitorum Abbreviatio</cite>,’ or Abstracts of the Pleadings
preserved in the Chapter House at Westminster,
London, 1811, folio.</p>

<p>“In this volume then, on page 316, column 2, we
find it stated, that during Easter Term, in the sixth
of the reign of King Edward II.,&mdash;that is to say
1312,&mdash;there were pleadings before the King, at
Westminster, concerning the property of the Master
of London Bridge, in certain Mills on the River Lee
in Essex; but as these pleadings refer to an Inquisition
originally made in the time of Edward I., the
present will be the most proper period to describe
and translate them. Stow mentions the circumstance,
when speaking of the office of Bridge-Master, in his
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume ii. page 25, in the following terms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
‘The Keeper of the Bridge House had, in ancient
times, an interest in certain Mills upon the River Lee,
near Stratford; and the Master of St. Thomas of
Acres,’&mdash;now Mercers’ Chapel, in Cheapside,&mdash;‘had a
title to other mills there. For, as it appears by an
old Inquisition, taken in the time of King Edward
the First, there was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calcetum</i>&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> a chalk causeway&mdash;on
the North, near Stratford, which was made
by Queen Maud, through which there were three
trenches made for three courses of water to run, for
the use of several mills, partly belonging to the
Master of St. Thomas, and partly to the Bridge
Master: over which were three wooden bridges made
by the said Masters. This is manifest by an extract
out of an ancient Inquisition taken at Stratford at
Bow, before Roger Brabanzon and others, in Anno
xxxii<sup>o</sup>.’&mdash;we shall presently find that this ought to have
been xxxi<sup>o</sup>.&mdash;‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regis Edwardi filii Regis Henrici</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;the
purport of which is, that there were three mills
made upon this chalk causeway Northward; one
a Fuller’s Mill, and the site of another mill belonging
to the Master of St. Thomas of Acre: and two other
Mills, called Sayen’s Mill, and Spileman’s Mill; the
one a Water Mill, and the other a Fuller’s Mill, both
held by the Keeper of London Bridge. From which
mills came three courses of water in three trenches,
made cross the chalk causeway by the said Master and
Keeper. Beyond which trenches were made three
wooden bridges in that said causeway by the said
Master and Keeper, which greatly wanted repair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>’
Now, Sir, I have already shewn you that in Easter
Term, in 1312, these pleadings of 1302-3 were renewed
against the Bridge Keeper, and the Master of
St. Thomas of Acres, by John de Norton, the King’s
Attorney General, who charged them to repair the
Bridges, according to the said presentment. The
pleadings of 1312 are recorded on Roll 95; and as the
form in which they are written is full of curious historical
matter, I shall give you a translation of the
instrument at length.</p>

<p>“‘Middlesex and Essex. Our Lord Edward, the
King’s Father, in the 31st year of his reign,’&mdash;namely,
1302, in which you see, this record, on authority we
cannot doubt, differs from Stow,&mdash;‘commanded Roger
de Brabanzon, William de Beresford, Roger de
Hegham, and Stephen de Gravesend, that they should
enquire who ought to repair the Bridges and Chalk
Causeway in the King’s Street between Stratford atte
Bowe, and Hamme Stratford; and concerning the
deficiencies of support, and repairs of the same,
which, from that Inquisition taken by a jury, namely,
by twelve for the County of Essex, and by twelve
others for the County of Middlesex,’ standeth thus:&mdash;‘They
said that the Ferry over the water of Luye,
or Lee, at Stratford atte Bowe, was anciently accustomed
to be in that place called Oldeforde, which
is one league distant from the place of both Bridges
and the Causeway, that now are near together; at
which Ferry, many crossing over from various places
have been plunged in the water and in danger. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
when, afterwards, such great danger came to be made
known to the Lady Matilda, then Queen of England,
Consort of our Lord Henry the First, King of England,
she, moved by her piety, commanded it to be
examined how both the Bridges and the Causeway
could be made better, and more convenient, for the
utility and easement of the country, and the passengers
over them. The which was done by the
said Queen, who also caused two Bridges to be built;
namely, the Bridge over the water of Lee at the
upper end of the town of Stratford atte Bowe,’&mdash;which
you remember Stow says, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.
page 58, in the margin, and elsewhere, was ‘the first
arched Bridge in England, and gave name to the
Town, for that it was shaped like a Bow:’&mdash;‘and
another Bridge over another trench of the same water
towards Essex, which is called Channelesbrigge. And
also one Chalk Causeway between the said Bridges, so
that all passengers going over it, may well and securely
cross the same. And, forasmuch as the said Queen
desired, that the reparation and support of the aforesaid
Bridges and Chalk Causeway should from that
time be imposed, so, out of her charity, she bought
those lands, rents, meadows, and one water-mill,
which is called Wiggemulne, and assigned and commanded
them to be for the repair and support of the
Bridges, and the Chalk Causeway aforesaid. And
because she believed that their repair and support
would be better done by religious men, if they were
thenceforward laid upon them, than by secular persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
lest that such secular persons themselves, or their
heirs, should, in the course of years, be wanting, to
preserve them: nor was there then any Religious
House near to the aforesaid Bridges and Chalk Causeway,
but the Abbey of Berkinggs, the Abbey of
Stratford not yet being founded; so that the aforesaid
lands, rents, meadows, and mill, with their appurtenances,
were then given to the Abbess of Berkinggs
and her house: so that she and her successors,
&amp;c. should for ever sustain and repair the said Bridges.
But afterwards, Gilbert de Mauntfichet founded the
Abbey of Stratford, &amp;c.’&mdash;that is to say about 1135,&mdash;‘And
a certain Abbot of the same house bought the
lands, &amp;c. from the aforesaid Abbess, because they
were near his Abbey, and lying, in situation, commodiously
for his house, that is to say, however,
undertaking, for himself and his successors, &amp;c. the
repair of the Bridges, and Chalk Causeway aforesaid,
for the Abbess herself, &amp;c. and farther giving to
the same four marks of silver,’&mdash;&pound;2. 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>&mdash;‘by the
Year, &amp;c. And so they were found, by the same
Inquisition,’&mdash;cited at the beginning of this instrument,&mdash;‘to
be decayed, and who ought to repair the said
Bridges and Chalk Causeway? Upon which Inquisition,
our Lord the King caused his writ to issue,
&amp;c.; and upon this precept it is shewn that the Abbot
aforesaid, the Master of the House of the Blessed
Thomas of Acre, and the Keeper of London Bridge,
made their appearance to answer why the Bridges
were not repaired, &amp;c. When the Jurors came, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
between the King and the Abbots, they said that
the said Abbot was not held to repair, excepting the
Bridge called Channelesbrigge, and that none of his
predecessors have, at any time, repaired the said
Bridges and Chalk Causeway, and that not any of
the lands or tenements held by him have been
accustomed to make reparations, or support them:&mdash;therefore
the Abbot was dismissed without a day.
But another of the Jurors has found that it is the
said Abbess who ought to repair the Bridges. And
at length,’&mdash;that is to say in 1315,&mdash;‘an agreement
was made between the said Abbot and Abbess, in the
presence of the Earl of Hereford and Essex, and
Chancellor of England; also Chief Justice, Chief
Baron, and Escheater of our Lord the King on this
side Trent, and it was enrolled that the said Abbot
obliges himself, and his successors, to repair for ever:
for which the said Abbess gives to the said Abbot
two hundred pounds, yet saving to her the annual
four marks.’ See the Pleadings before the King at
Westminster, in Easter Term, 6 Edward II., Roll 95.</p>

<p>“After this very long, though curious document,
I have nothing farther to observe on the connection of
the Bridge Master of London, and his Mill and
Bridge on the River Lee, than that, although he at
first traversed, as the Lawyers say, or denied his
right to repair them, yet, in 1315, the original claim
was confirmed against his denial, as is asserted by
Stow, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume ii. page 25.”</p>

<p>“Methinks, Mr. Barnaby Postern,” said I, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
before you entirely quit the connection of the Lee
River and London Bridge, it would not be irrelevant
to speak somewhat of that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantiuncula</i>, that little
song, or, as I may properly call it, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lallus</i>, for it
is truly a nurse’s song, in which they are both united.”</p>

<p>“You say well, Sir,” answered my visitor; “and
seeing that I have already spoken somewhat at length,
‘shall I,’ as Izaak Walton says, ‘have nothing from
you, that seem to have both a good memory, and a
cheerful spirit?’ Come, then, my honoured kinsman,
do you relate what hath been written and collected
concerning that same <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantiuncula</i>; nor deem that any
fragmenta, touching the history of London Bridge,
can be uninteresting; wherefore, doubt not but your
narrative will be to me like that which Adam made
to Raphael:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tongue ineloquent.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thy relation now; for I attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.’”</span>
</div></div>

<p>“After the deep reading and extensive knowledge,”
returned I, “which you, Mr. Postern, have displayed
in your discourse, it is unfortunate for me to have to
speak upon a subject, where I am no less perplexed
by the paucity of materials, than by my own ignorance
of many which may be in existence. For you
must know, my fellow-antiquary, that searching out
the origin and history of a ballad, is like endeavouring
to ascertain the source and flight of December’s snow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
since it often comes we know not whence, is looked
upon and noticed for awhile, is corrupted, or melts
away, we know not how, and thus dies unrecorded,
excepting in the oral tradition or memory of some
village crones, who yet discourse of it. However,
Sir, to proceed methodically, I will first give you the
words of this very popular song; then the customs
and history connected with it; and, lastly, the musical
notation to which it is most commonly sung.</p>

<p>“One of the most elegant copies of this ballad you
will find in the late Joseph Ritson’s rare and curious
volume, entitled, ‘<em>Gammer Gurton’s Garland: or the
Nursery Parnassus. A choice collection of pretty
Songs, and Verses, for the amusement of all little good
children who can neither read nor run.</em>’ London, 1810.

<p>“In that treasury of singular fragments, the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite>,’ for September, 1823, volume xciii.,
page 232, there is another copy of this ballad, with
some variations, inserted in a Letter, signed M. Green,
in which there are the following stanzas, wanting in
Ritson’s, and coming in immediately after the third
verse, ‘Silver and gold will be stolen away;’ though it
must be observed, that the propositions for building
the Bridge with iron and steel, and wood and stone,
have, in this copy also, already been made and objected

<p>“I pray you, do not fail to observe in these verses,
how singularly and happily the burthen of the song
often falls in with the subject of the new line: though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I am half inclined to think, that the whole ballad has
been formed by many fresh additions, in a long series of
years, and is, perhaps, almost interminable when received
in all its different versions. Mr. Green, in his
letter which I last quoted, remarks that, the stanzas
I have repeated to you are ‘the introductory lines of
an old ballad, which, more than seventy years previous,
he had heard plaintively warbled by a lady,
who was born in the reign of Charles the Second,
and who lived till nearly that of George the Second.’
Another Correspondent to the same Magazine, whose
contribution, signed D, is inserted in the same volume,
December, page 507, observes, that the ballad concerning
London Bridge formed, in his remembrance,
part of a Christmas Carol, and commenced thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Dame, get up and bake your pies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Christmas day in the morning:’</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">‘The requisition,’ he continues, ‘goes on to the Dame
to prepare for the feast, and her answer is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘London Bridge is broken down,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Christmas day in the morning.’</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">‘The inference always was, that until the Bridge was
rebuilt, some stop would be put to the Dame’s Christmas
operations; but why the falling of a part of
London Bridge should form part of a Christmas
Carol at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I am at a loss to
know.’ This connection has, doubtless, long since
been gathered into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> ‘wallet which Time carries at
his back, wherein he puts alms for oblivion;’ though
we may remark, that the history and features of the old
Bridge of that famous town had a very close resemblance
to that of London; as you may find upon
reading the Rev. John Brand’s ‘<cite>History and Antiquities
of the Town and County of the Town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne</cite>.’
London, 1789. 4to. volume i., pages
31-53. The chief points of resemblance between
these two Bridges, were, that both were founded in
the hidden years of remote antiquity; that in each
instance wooden Bridges preceded the stone ones;
that to each was attached a Chapel dedicated to St.
Thomas; that continual dilapidations and Patents for
repair characterised each; that both formed a street
of houses, having towers, gates, and drawbridges;
and, finally, that in 1771, a violent flood reduced the
Bridge of Tyne to the same hapless state as erst
marked that of London, when ruinated by the terrible
fire of 1757. Such, Mr. Postern, are the words,
and such are the very few historical notices that I am
able to give you, of a song, of which there is, perhaps,
not a single dweller in the Bills of Mortality, who
has not heard somewhat; and yet not one of whom can
tell you more concerning it, than that they have heard
it sung ‘many years ago,’ as the gossiping phrase is.
If one might hazard a conjecture concerning it, I
should refer its composition to some very ancient
date, when London Bridge lying in ruins, the office of
Bridge Master was vacant; and his power over the
River Lee&mdash;for it is doubtless that River which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
celebrated in the chorus to this song,&mdash;was for a while
at an end. But this, although the words and melody
of the verses be extremely simple, is all uncertain; and
thus, my good Sir, do general traditions float down
the stream of Time, without any fixed date; for none
regard them as of value enough to record, whilst
they are yet known in all their primitive truth. Oh!
how many an interesting portion of History has been
thus lost! How many a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” interrupted my visitor at this part of
my apostrophe, “to find that I am not the <em>only</em> Antiquary
who is apt to be led away from narrative to
rhetoric; and who is sometimes induced to declaim
when he set out to describe. But you were speaking
of the melody to this song, Mr. Barbican; now I would
fain hear it, if it live in your memory.”</p>

<p>“Give me a draught of sack,” said I, taking up the
tankard, “and you shall hear it, as well as my feeble
voice, now ‘turning again to childish treble,’ Mr.
Postern, hath the skill to chaunt it. But look for
nothing fine, Mr. Barnaby: here are none of Von
Weber’s notes; and, indeed, I know of nothing which
so well characterises it, as that fine description of a
popular ballad in <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spinsters, and the Knitters in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do use to chaunt it&mdash;&mdash;’”</span>
</div></div>

<p>“Come, my good Sir,” replied Mr. Postern, “no
more words on’t, but sing, I pray you.”</p>

<div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>“Then listen,” answered I, clearing my throat to
reach the treble C, with which the melody commences;
“but you must sing a part of it, as it stands in this
paper, Master Barnaby, for it begins with the chorus;
and so here follows the ancient Music to the Song
and Dance of London Bridge is broken down.”</p>

<p>“A choice piece of simple melody, indeed,” said
Mr. Postern, as I finished the last strain of the solo,
“and, certainly, from its extreme plainness, not unlikely
to be of some considerable antiquity; but you
called it also a dance, Mr. Barbican; pray was it ever
adapted to the feet, as well as to the tongue?”</p>
</div>

<p>“You shall hear, Sir,” returned I, “for I learn
from a Manuscript communication, from a Mr. J.
Evans, of Bristol, which has been most kindly placed
in my hands by the venerable proprietor of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>‘<cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite>,’ and which enclosed the notes of
the tune we have now concluded; that ‘about forty
years ago, one moonlight night, in a street in Bristol,
his attention was attracted by a dance and chorus of
boys and girls, to which the words of this ballad gave
measure. The breaking down of the Bridge was
announced as the dancers moved round in a circle,
hand in hand; and the question, ‘How shall we
build it up again?’ was chaunted by the leader, whilst
the rest stood still.’ The same correspondent also
farther observes, that it is possible some musical critics
may trace in these notes sundry fragments that have
sailed down the stream of Time, beginning with
‘<cite>Nancy Dawson</cite>,’ and ‘<cite>A frog he would a wooing go</cite>;’
though the Lament of London Bridge is certainly far,
very far, anterior to the latter. I cannot, however,
imagine, that the air of our ballad has more than
a very distant consanguinity with either; for the
melody of Nancy Dawson is generally supposed not
to be more than sixty years old, about which time its
heroine flourished; and the metre of that worthless
song is perfectly different, each verse having eight lines
instead of four. Now, when Isaac Bickerstaff produced
his Opera of ‘<cite>Love in a Village</cite>,’ he composed
his 14th air, in the last Scene of the first Act, to that
very tune; for there the Housemaid commences the
Finale, and thus it runs:</p>

<p>“Thus, you observe, my good Sir, that the verse
has no resemblance at all; and the only similitude
of the music lies in a very few notes in the second
and third bars of the first and fourth lines. The Adventures
of the Frog who went a courting is certainly
much more like the ballad of London Bridge; but, in
addition to its variations in the latter part, it is quite
a modern composition, and, therefore, cannot illustrate
the antiquity of that other song, of which it is itself
merely a musical parody.”</p>

<p>“My hearty thanks are due to you, Mr. Geoffrey
Barbican,” began Mr. Postern, as I concluded; “I
have to thank you very heartily for the agreeable
manner in which you have contrived to carry on the
history of London Bridge, whilst I have breathed
from continuing my duller detail: and now, let me
observe, that having brought you down to the 31st
year of the reign of Edward I., 1302, I shall give
you a translation of what was, perhaps, his last and
fullest Charter to London Bridge, in the form of
a Patent of Pontage, or Bridge Tax, granted in 1305,
the 34th year of his sovereignty; which is curious,
inasmuch as it enumerates so many of the articles of
commerce in that day. The original is, of course, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>“Such, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, is a tolerably exact
translation of this long and very curious Patent of
Pontage for London Bridge; but a perfect rendering of
it into English is a matter attended with more than
usual difficulty; since it is composed of so many barbarous
Anglo-Norman nouns, with Latin terminations
attached to them; of quaint legal phrases, of which
Fortescue and Rastall must be the interpreters; and
of numerous articles of which both the names and the
nature are to us almost utterly unintelligible. However,
Sir, I here give it you to the best of my poor
skill; and in doing so, let me add to it the apologetical
words of your namesake and fellow citizen, the amiable
old Chaucer;&mdash;‘Now pray I to them all that
hearken this treatise, or rede, that if there be any thing
that liketh them, that thereof they thank Him, of
whom proceedeth all wit and goodness. And if there
be any thing that displease them, I pray them also
that they arrette it to the default of mine unknonnyng,
and not to my will, that would fain have said better
if I had knowing.’”</p>

<p>“Doubtless, Mr. Postern,” answered I, “my civilities
are at the least due to you, for the labour you
bestow upon me; but yet I must be so plain as to
tell you, that your Pontage Patent reminded me
mightily of a Table of Tolls at a Turnpike-Gate,
whereon we read ‘For every horse, mare, gelding,
or mule, laden or unladen, not drawing, two pence,’
So again, and again, I say, let me have stories, man!
I want stories! ‘for,’ as Oliver Goldsmith said of old
to the Ghost of <em>Dame Quickly</em>, ‘if you have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
but tedious remarks to communicate, seek some
other hearer, I am determined to hearken only to
stories.’”</p>

<p>“Be of a sweet temper, however you may be disappointed,
Mr. Geoffrey,” replied the old Gentleman;
“if I possessed the wit either of honest Oliver, or the
Ghost of Mistress Quickly, you should, indeed, be
entertained; but, seeing that we lack humour, we
must make it up in the real, though somewhat dull,
formula of past days. This time, I have, however,
a romantic scene for you <em>in petto</em>, and even now we
have arrived at a point of the history of London
Bridge, which, when skilfully managed, with a little
fiction, has drawn tears from many an eye, and awakened
an interest in many a heart: I mean the
capture and death of the brave and unfortunate Sir
William Wallace.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘Joy, joy in London now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He goes, the rebel Wallace goes to death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the traitor meets a traitor’s doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Joy, joy in London now!’</span>
</div></div>

<p>“It was after the return of the fourth expedition
of King Edward I. into Scotland, about the
beginning of August, 1305, that London Bridge was
defaced, by the placing upon it the trophies of his
vengeance. Matthew of Westminster, in his ‘<cite>Flowers
of Histories</cite>,’ which I have already cited to you, tells
the sorrowful story of Sir William Wallace’s execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in his Second Book, page 451; beginning at
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic vir Belial</i>,’&mdash;for he treats the Scottish hero with
but little reverence,&mdash;and in plain English thus runs
the narrative. ‘This man of Belial, after innumerable
crimes, was at last taken by the King’s officers,
and, by his command, was brought up to be judged
by himself, attended by the Nobles of the kingdom
of England, on the Vigil of St. Bartholomew’s day,’&mdash;the
23rd of August,&mdash;‘where he was condemned to
a most cruel, yet most worthy death. Firstly, he was
drawn at the tail of a horse through the fields of
London, to a very lofty gibbet, erected for him, upon
which he was hung with a halter; afterwards, he was
taken down half dead, embowelled, and his intestines
burned by fire; lastly, his head was cut off, and set
upon a pole on London Bridge, whilst the trunk was
cut into four quarters. His body, thus divided, was
sent into four parts of Scotland. Behold! such was
the unpitied end of this man, whom want of pity
brought to such a death!’</p>

<p>“The head of the gallant but ill-fated Wallace
was not, however, the only ghastly spectacle upon
London Bridge; for the Catalogue of the Harleian
Manuscripts, under the Number 2253, has the following
notice at article 25:&mdash;‘<em>A long Ballad against
the Scots, many of whom are here mentioned by name, as
also many of the English, besides the King and Prince.
But, particularly of William Walleys, taken at the Battle
of Dunbar, A. D. 1305, and of Simon Frisell,&mdash;or
Fraser,&mdash;taken at the Battle of Kyrkenclyf, A. D. 1306,</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<em>both of whom were punished as traitors to our King
Edward I. and their heads set among others of their
countrymen upon London Bridge.</em>’ The passage which
immediately concerns our purpose, you will find at
folio 61&#8201;a, and, in its own rude dialect, thus it runs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, as these barbarous
rhymes are but just intelligible, even to an Antiquary,
by a very careful reading and consideration, you will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
I dare say, excuse me, if I give you a paraphrase of
them in modern prose; which would be expressed
somewhat in this manner.&mdash;With fetters and with leg-irons
I wot that he was drawn from the Tower of
London that many might know it; dressed in a short
coat of coarse cloth, through Cheapside, having on his
head a garland of the last fashion; and many Englishmen,
to see Simon Frisel, began to run thither. Then
was he brought to the gibbet, and first being hung, he
was also beheaded, which he thought it long ere he endured
it. After, he was opened, and his bowels burned;
but his head was sent to London Bridge, to affright
beholders: so ever might I thrive, as that once he
little thought to stand there. He rides through the
City, as I may well tell you, with game and gladness
around him, which was the rejoicing of his enemies,
and he took the way to London Bridge. Many were
the wives’ children that looked upon him, and said,
Alas, that he was born! and so vilely forsaken, so
terrible a man as he was! Now the head stands
above the Town bridge, close to that of Wallace,
truly to say.</p>

<p>“Such is this ballad account of the matter; and,
in quitting my notice of the manuscript that contains
it, I have but to say that, it is written on old discoloured
parchment, in a square gothic text, the ink
of which is turned brown by time, with many contractions,
and much vile spelling; and that its other
contents are all exceedingly curious and valuable; and,
as the ‘<cite>Harleian Catalogue</cite>,’ volume i., at page 585,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
tells us, they are ‘partly in old French, partly in
Latin, and partly in English, partly in verse, and
partly in prose.’ You will find, however, the whole
of this long Poem printed in the late Joseph Ritson’s
interesting volume, entitled, ‘<cite>Ancient Songs from the
time of King Henry the Third to the Revolution</cite>,’ London,
1790, 8vo., pages 5-18. Maitland himself also relates
the fate of Sir William Wallace, at page 109 of his
‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ verifying his narrative by references to
several of the Cloisteral Historians; nor does there, I
believe, exist any earlier notice of the Tower on
London Bridge having been used for the terrific
purpose of exhibiting the heads of such as were executed
for High Treason, which procured for it the
name of Traitors’ Gate. You will remember I have
already proved that edifices were standing upon
London Bridge at a very early period; and, were it
required, here is an additional proof of it, not to be
disputed. Stow, when he is speaking of the Towers
upon the Bridge, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., pages
61 and 64, gives us not a word concerning their age,
so of that I must treat hereafter, when we come
down to the years in which they were repaired, or
rebuilt; and I will, therefore, here remark only, that
the heads were at this time erected on a Tower at the
North end, and that they were not removed to the
Southern extremity, where they so long remained,
until about the year 1579.</p>

<p>“I am for <em>your</em> sake, my good friend, truly sorry that
my next notice of London Bridge must be another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Patent Roll, of the 14th year of King Edward II.,&mdash;1320,&mdash;Part
the First, Membrane the 19th; but, it
shews, at any rate, the state of the edifice in that year:
and you will find it referred to in Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i., page 60; in Maitland’s ‘<cite title="History of London">History</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 47; in the original Latin in Hearne’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber
Niger</cite>,’ volume i., page *477; and in English it ran as
follows.</p>

<p>“‘Concerning the subsidies of the Messengers for
the work of the Bridge of London, complaining to
be admitted.</p>

<p>“‘The King to the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots,
Priors, Rectors, and all other Ministers of the Holy
Mother Church, to whom these presents shall come,&mdash;Greeting.
Seeing that, even now, so many evils,&mdash;not
only in the loss of goods, but that innumerable bodies
of men are in peril through the ruin of the Bridge at
London,&mdash;are likely soon to come to pass, if that they
should not be taken away: we, being willing to provide
against this kind of dangers, and to take care of
the public and private interests, do desire you, when
the keepers of the costly work of the Bridge aforesaid,
or their messengers, whom we undertake specially
to protect and defend, shall come to collect every
where throughout your Dioceses, Rectories, or any
other of your jurisdictions, aids for the said work
from the pious and the devout, you do, in friendship,
admit them, from the contemplation of God, the
regard of charity, and for evidence of devotion in
this matter: admitting them to excite the people by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
their pious persuasions, and charitably to invoke the
assistance of their alms for the reparation of the
Bridge aforesaid. Not bringing upon them, nor permitting
to be brought upon them, any injuries,
molestations, damage, impediment, or grievance. And
if any thing shall have been forfeited by them,
amends shall be made without delay. In testimonial
of which, &amp;c. Witness the King, at Langele, the
Thirteenth day of August.’</p>

<p>“A much more curious instrument than this, however,
is recorded on the Patent Rolls of the 17th
Year of Edward II.,&mdash;1323,&mdash;Part the Second, Membrane
9; inasmuch as it particularises several parts of
the Bridge property in the ancient Stocks Market, of
which we should now be without the knowledge, if it
had not been for the careful enumeration of them which
is here contained. You will see, that this confirmatory
instrument has particular reference to one which I
have already rehearsed to you, and that it is of that
kind, commonly called an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inspeximus</i>, from the Latin
word used in their commencement, meaning, ‘we
have seen,’ because the words of the original Charter
are there repeated. This Patent is entitled ‘For the
Keepers of the Bridge of London;’ the original
Latin may be seen on page *482 of Hearne’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber
Niger</cite>,’ volume i.; and the English of it runs in the
following terms.</p>

<p>“‘The King to all to whom, &amp;c. Greeting. We
have seen a Charter belonging to the Mayor, Aldermen,
and Commonalty of the City of London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
written in these words.&mdash;‘To all the faithful in Christ

Commonalty of the City of London, Greeting:’ Know
ye that as the Lord Edward, formerly King of England,

North part of the Parish of the same Church, should
be built upon and rented for the support of the

expedient for their commodity, and that of this great
City; and that the said places, so built upon and
rented, should be held by themselves, and their heirs,
for the support of the Bridge aforesaid, for ever,
even as in the aforesaid letters is fully contained.
And the before-mentioned Henry, the Mayor, and
the Commonalty of the City aforesaid, for the common
profit of their City, have built and constructed that
house upon the places aforesaid, and have called it
the Stokkes, and they have ordained the same for the
Butchers and Fishmongers selling therein, as in a
place situated nearly in the midst of the City; and
the rents from the stalls are assigned for the increasing
and support of the aforesaid Bridge. For
the Stalls of the Butchers, and of the Fishmongers,
may not be permitted, excepting, namely, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
broad way of Bridge Street, of East Cheap, and in
the way of Old Fish Street, and the Butcher Row
on the West, in the Parish of St. Nicholas; even as
it was anciently accustomed to be, according to the
ordinance and disposal of the aforesaid Henry, and
the then Common Council of the City aforesaid, as
in this part we have seen fully to be preserved: at
which time the Butchers and Fishmongers sold their
flesh and fish in the same, and in none other of the
contiguous places and neighbourhoods, excepting the
streets before mentioned, and the rents of the said
stalls were carried to the keepers of the said Bridge,
who, for a time, returned them in aid of the support
of the said Bridge. But we, the aforesaid Mayor
and Aldermen, lately receiving the complaint of John
Sterre and Roger Atte-Wynne, Keepers of the Bridge
aforesaid, that the Butchers and Fishmongers of the
City aforesaid, who ought to stand to sell their flesh
and fish in the place aforesaid, have accustomed
themselves to diminish the rents of the aforesaid,
contriving another stall for selling their flesh and fish,
at the top of King Street, and in other contiguous
places and neighbourhoods without the house aforesaid,
that such persons for stalls existing within the
house aforesaid, pay nothing, against the ordinance
in this article formerly provided; and by their own
authority they have prepared, and have sold their
flesh and fish; by which the rents aforesaid, on
which, in great part, the maintenance of the aforesaid
Bridge exists, will be immensely reduced. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
which the said keepers supplicate us for their remedy,
to be by us applied. And we having considered
this, whether that such kinds of sales may any longer
be tolerated in the Bridge aforesaid, and in the aforesaid
City, as, to all crossing by that Bridge, peril and
damage may manifestly happen: and also this, that
our Lord the King, by his writ, hath given it in command,
that those things which in the premises are
least according to custom, and against the aforesaid
ordinance, should be attempted to be corrected and
amended, and in their original state rebuilt,&mdash;we
should build. And being willing to provide against
such kinds of damages and perils, and to be obedient
in all things to the commands of our Lord aforesaid,
we have caused to be called before us the Butchers and
Fishmongers aforesaid, and also those that have sold
their flesh and fish in other contiguous places and
neighbourhoods, without the house aforesaid, against
the aforesaid ordinance; and in the discourse which
we have held, there was nothing which they have
said in this matter, nor have known to be said, by
which the said ordinance ought to be invalidated,
but they have petitioned that the ordinance and
agreement formerly made in this article, might be
observed. We therefore looked at the ordinance for
this kind of sales, and the ancient customs, and
saw the agreement of the aforesaid Henry le Waleys,
then Mayor, concerning this kind of sales, made and
ordained by the consent of the whole Commonalty;
and by our general consent, and that of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Commonalty aforesaid, we have agreed, and granted,
that the aforesaid ancient ordinances and agreements
concerning this kind of sales, be, for the future, firmly
and permanently established: so that if any shall
have offended, or have spoken against the aforesaid
ancient ordinances and customs, they shall, firstly,
lose the thing exposed for sale; and, secondly, they
shall lose the liberty of the aforesaid City, according
to the laws and customs of the same City, as hath
been anciently accustomed to be done. And because
it is useful that we revolve excellent things which are
departed, and ancient things lying obscured to lead
into light, that by the same the memory of perishable
matters may be recalled to sense, and offenders themselves
be made to abstain from evil actions on account
of their perpetual memory, for the strengthening of
these presents we have caused to be attached to them
the Common Seal of our City aforesaid, under the
custody of the aforesaid keepers, and of the succeeding
keepers, who, for the time, have been, and
are for ever to be preserved. Given in Guildhall,
London, before the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty
aforesaid, on Saturday next after the Feast of
Saint Valentine,’&mdash;February the 14th,&mdash;‘in the seventeenth
Year of the reign of King Edward the son of
King Edward.&mdash;We have also granted and confirmed
the ordinances, agreements, contracts, and
grants aforesaid, and all other things contained in the
aforesaid writing, having established and acknowledged
them for us and our heirs, so much as in us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
lies, as the aforesaid writing may fairly witness. In
testimony of which, &amp;c. Witness the King, at the
Tower of London, the 16th day of June. For a fine
of ten marks:’&mdash;that is to say the sum of &pound;6. 13<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em></p>

<p>“Before entering upon the tumultuous reign of
Richard II. I must observe to you, Mr. Barbican, that
in the Patent Roll for the 42nd of Edward III.&mdash;1368,&mdash;Membrane
21, there is a sort of memorandum
of a transfer of a piece of ground from the Friars
Minors for the support of London Bridge, the title of
which is couched in the following terms: ‘The
Guardians of the Friars Minors of London remit for
ever to the Mayor, &amp;c. of London, one portion of land
on the Southern side of the Church within Newgate,
in London, for the support of the Bridge at London,
they giving for the same, to the Abbot of Westminster,
the sum of four shillings, the which is contained in
divers covenants: the King hath confirmed it.’</p>

<p>“Well!” said I to Mr. Postern, on his conclusion
of these Patents, “this succession of your dull and
never-ending Charters would weary the patience of
the most phlegmatic Dutch Lawyer that ever studied
at Leyden. Come there any more of them, my honest
friend? or may we yet look out for land, after so
long tossing in the wide sea of the Tower Records?”</p>

<p>“Tranquillise your perturbed feelings, my good
Sir,” replied Mr. Barnaby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> “for we are now drawing
very rapidly towards that time, when we can give
only mere facts, and descriptive scenes of history,
unsupported by any of those curious and unquestionable
proofs which these evidences furnish. Not
but that there are, doubtless, yet many scores of most
interesting papers and Charters concerning this
Bridge, preserved in the Close Rolls, the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli
Chartarum</cite>,’ the Patent Rolls, and the vast body of
the Records of this kingdom: but life is too short,
and the search would be too long, to discover them
all; though I would, for your sake, that I knew them
better, and could delight your ears with their recital.”</p>

<p>“God forbid! Mr. Postern,” ejaculated I, “that
you should bestow all your tediousness upon me!
for truly, from that which you have recited, I have
some conception of what the whole must be; and I
would rather entreat you now to pass on to some of
those same ‘facts, and descriptive scenes of history,’
which you seem to undervalue so much, because they
do not drag a wearisome Patent Roll after them.
Therefore once more, Master Barnaby, I say, give
me a tale.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned he, “as we have now arrived at
rather an eventful period, perhaps you will begin to
be more gratified; and here let me remark that the
gate of London Bridge being so advantageous, as
well as so immediate, an entrance into the very heart
of the City, was too often the favourite passage by
which the rebels of ancient days marched into the
bowels of our hapless land. I have already given
you one instance of this, in speaking of the Baronial
Wars of the days of King Henry III.; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
now, when we have arrived at the Year 1381,
the 5th of Richard II., we find another melancholy
instance of it in the insurrection of Wat Tyler.
Stow notices this but very slightly in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i., page 61; though in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ to which
he there refers, page 283, he gives a much more full
account of their proceedings on London Bridge,
taken chiefly from the ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>’ of Thomas Walsingham,
a native of Norfolk, and a Monk of St.
Albans Abbey, who lived in the time of Henry VI.,
and died in 1440; his history commencing at the end
of the reign of King Henry III. His principal work,
entitled ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronica Thom&aelig; Walsingham, quondam
Monachi Sancti Albani</cite>,’ will be found in William
Camden’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anglica, Normannica, Hibernica, Cambrica,
a Veteribus Scripta</cite>,’ Frankfurt, 1603, Folio;
where, on page 249 you will find his account of it;
but, however, we’ll take the English one of old Stow,
from the page which I have already cited.</p>

<p>“‘On which day,’ says he, meaning Thursday, the
Feast of Corpus Christi,&mdash;or June the 13th,&mdash;‘also in
the morning, the Commons of Kent brake downe the
stew-houses neare to London Bridge, at that time in
the hands of the frowes of Flanders, who had farmed
them of the Mayor of London. After which, they
went to London Bridge, in hope to have entred the
Citty; but the Maior,’&mdash;the famous Sir William
Walworth, you remember,&mdash;‘comming thither before,
fortified the place, caused the Bridge to be drawne
vp, and fastened a great chaine of yron a crosse, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
restraine their entry. Then the Commons of Surrey,
who were risen with other, cried to the Wardens
of the Bridge to let it downe, whereby they mought
passe, or else they would destroy them all, whereby
they were constrained for feare to let it down, and
give them entry, at which time the religious present,’&mdash;perhaps
he means the Brethren of the Bridge,&mdash;‘were
earnest in procession and prayer for peace.’</p>

<p>As this fragment of History brought to my recollection
a point of Heraldical enquiry, which I had
long considered, I here interrupted my visitor, in the
following words.</p>

<p>“I cannot, Mr. Barnaby Postern, turn from the
days of that most notorious rebel, Wat Tyler, without
briefly noticing the dispute concerning the Armorial
Ensigns of our goodly City, which claim to have had
an honourable augmentation arising from the gallantry
of the Lord Mayor of that period. If rhyme
might pass for reason and argument, we should then
be assured of the origin of the City’s Dagger, from
the evidence afforded by those verses, which are inscribed
beneath Walworth’s effigy in the Fishmongers’
Hall, above us; and which run&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘Brave Walworth, Knight, Lord Mayor, yet slew</span><br />
<span class="i4">Rebellious Tyler in his alarmes;</span><br />
<span class="i2">The King therefore did give in lieu</span><br />
<span class="i4">The dagger to the City’s Arms.</span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the fourth Year of Richard II., Anno Domini, 1381.’</span>
</div></div>

<p>“This, however, can stand for nothing, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
arguments for, and against, the popular reason for the
introduction of the weapon, are best learned from
the ancient English Chronicles and Historians of
London. The principal Authors who assert that
King Richard added the Dagger to commemorate the
loyal valour of Walworth, are Richard Grafton, in
his ‘<cite>Chronicle at large, and meere History of the
Affayres of Englande, and Kinges of the same</cite>,’
London, 1569, folio, page 340; in the Margin: Raphael
Holinshed, in his ‘<cite>Chronicles of England, Scotland,
and Ireland</cite>,’ London, 1586, volume ii., page
436: John Speed, in his ‘<cite>Theatre of the Empire of
Great Britaine</cite>,’ London, 1611, folio, volume ii., page
596; and Sir Richard Baker, in his ‘<cite>Chronicle of
the Kings of England</cite>,’ London, 1733, folio, page 140.</p>

<p>“Such are the assertors of this very common legend;
and the evidence against it, is given, firstly by old
Stow, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 506, at that
part of it where he is treating of Walworth’s Monument,
in the Church of St. Michael, Crooked Lane.
He there states, you know, that, in the fourth Year
of King Richard II.,&mdash;1380,&mdash;it was determined, in a
Court of the Aldermen and Common Council of the
City, that the old seal of the Mayoralty of London
should be destroyed, and a new one, engraven with
greater skill, then be provided. The device upon the
new seal consisted of the effigies of the Saints Peter
and Paul, with the Blessed Virgin above them, supported
between two Angels, under as many tabernacles.
Beneath the feet of the Saints were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Armorial Ensigns of the City, supported by two
Lions, and two Serjeants at Arms. Now, Stow’s deductions
from this fact are, firstly, that as the Mayor
is not called by any title of Knighthood in this Seal,
it was made before he received that dignity, and,
therefore, before his gallant action in Smithfield,
or, the augmentation could have been made to the
City Arms. Secondly, he argues, that the Arms were
the same in the old seal as in the new, and that,
consequently, the weapon was not the dagger of
Walworth, but the sword of St. Paul; for when the
turbulent Robert Fitz-Walter was Banner-bearer to
the City of London, his standard was red, charged
with the image of St. Paul in gold, holding a sword,
which, together with the head, hands, and feet of
the effigy, was silver. These particulars you will also
find in Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 65; and such
is the attempt of this worthy historian to prove the
weapon to have been the sword of St. Paul’s Martyrdom,
at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqu&aelig; Salvi&aelig;</i>, on the 29th of June, A. D.
66. Now, since that holy Martyr is oftentimes called,
by the more ancient writers, ‘the titularie patron of
London,’ and since her chiefest metropolitan fane was,
so early as 610, dedicated to his ever-fragrant memory,
there is nothing impossible, or even unlikely,
in all this: and that it should have been so, certainly
arises from the circumstance that ‘Paul preached in
the Islande of Britaine, which cannot be doubted;
seeing both Sophronius, Patriarche of Jerusalem,
and Theodoret, an ancient Doctor of the Chvrche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
doe affirme and approve the same, saying that Fishers,
Publicans, and the Tent-maker,’&mdash;St. Paul, see Acts
xviii. 3,&mdash;‘which brought the evangelical light unto
all nations, revealed the same unto the Britaines.’</p>

<p>“The only authority adduced by Stow for the
support of his novel hypothesis concerning the Dagger
of London, is a Manuscript preserved in the City
Chamber, and called ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Dunthorne</cite>,’ from William
Dunthorne, the name of its author. It is, in form,
a large folio volume, written in a very fair, small,
black law text, on vellum; and its contents are ancient
Civic Laws, commencing with the series of the
City Charters, in the first of which, granted by William
I., the initial W contains an illumination of the
effigy of St. Paul, as already described. I will add
only, that this venerable register is bound in wood,
covered with rough calf leather, and garnished with
brass bosses and clasps, now black with age; whilst
on the cover, under a plate of horn, surrounded by
a metal frame, is a piece of parchment bearing the
name ‘<em>Dvnthorne</em>.’</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding, however, that the effigy of the
most glorious Apostle St. Paul might be advanced
into the banner of London, I think it still probable
that the ancient Civic Armorial Ensigns were a White
Shield bearing a Red Cross, having the first quarter
either uncharged, or charged, as a distinction from
the multitudes of places and persons which adopted
the same insignia. For you may observe, that the
Cross was anciently and commonly used by all Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
as their badge; some Heralds deriving its introduction
from the Emperor Constantine the Great,
and others from so holy a person as Joseph, the Son
of Joseph of Arimathea; who, being the first preacher
of Christianity in Britain, when dying, drew with his
own blood a red cross on a white banner, and promised
victory to its followers, whilst they continued
in the Christian faith. There is also much mystical
meaning in this plain, yet noble ensign; for ‘the
white shielde,’ says a very ancient and interesting
author, ‘betokeneth purenes of life, and the crosse,
the bludd that Christ shed for us, his especialle
people of Englande.’&mdash;‘King Arthur,’ too, says John
Bossewell, in his very rare and curious ‘<cite>Workes of
Armorie</cite>,’ London, 1597, small 4to., Part 2., page 22&#8201;a,
‘that mightie Conquerour and worthie, had so great
affection and loue to this signe, that he left his Armes
which he bare before, and assumpted, or tooke to his
Armes, as proper to his desire, a Crosse siluer, in a
field vert; and on the first quarter thereof, was
figured an Image of our Lady, with her Sonne in her
armes. And bearing that signe, he did many marueiles
in Armes, as in his books of Acts and valiant
Conquests are remembred. Thus,’ adds he, ‘in olde
time it may be perceiued what Princes thought of the
Crosse.’ Now, without believing this origin to its
utmost extent, we may nevertheless learn thereby, of
how great antiquity is the bearing of that most honourable
Ordinary; ‘whose godly observation,’ says
John Guillim, in his ‘<cite>Display of Heraldry</cite>,’ best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
edition, by James Coats, London, 1724, folio, page 51,
‘was in great use in the primitive Church; though,
in later times, it hath been dishonourably entertained
by two kinds of fantastics; the one, who so superstitiously
doat on it that they adore it like their God;
the other, who so unchristianly detest it, that they
slander the most godly and ancient use thereof in our
first initiating unto Christ, as if it were some devilish
idol. But the true soldiers of such a captain, need
not to be ashamed to bear his ensign.’</p>

<p>“There is also yet another historical reason given
why the Red Cross of St. George should be so often
adopted in England; for it is related, that when
Robert, Duke of Normandy, the son of our King
William I., was prosecuting his victories against the
Turks, and laying siege to the famous City of Antioch,
A. D. 1098, it was almost relieved by a considerable
army of Saracens. In this difficulty there appeared
the beatific vision of St. Demetrius, St. Mercurius,
and St. George, coming down from the mountains of
Syria; the latter being clothed entirely in white, and
bearing a Red Cross on his banner, and, at the head
of an innumerable reinforcement; which miraculous
interference not only reanimated the Christians, but
also caused the infidels to fly, and the Crusaders to
possess themselves of the City. This legend is related
by Matthew Paris, a Monk of St. Albans, in the
13th century, in his ‘<cite>Historia Major</cite>,’ Paris, 1644,
folio, page 29: and it consequently made St. George
to become exceedingly famous at that time; and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
be esteemed a patron, not of the English only, but of
Christianity itself.</p>

<p>“So much, Mr. Barnaby, for the use of the Cross
in our City Arms; and as to the distinction borne in
the first quarter, there are some who hold the belief
that the Roman letter L once occupied the place of
the sword. This story appears to have originated
with a Mr. William Smith, a Merchant of London,
who was created Rouge Dragon Pursuivant of Arms,
on October the 22nd, 1597. As he had travelled
much on the Continent, and ‘was honest, of a quiet
conversation, and well-languaged,’ the Officers of the
Heralds’ College solicited to have him joined to their
society; and it was from the reminiscences of his
former travels, that he was enabled to state the following
particulars concerning the original distinction
attached to the City Arms, wherein he opposes the
hypothesis of Stow. ‘The Auncient Armes of the
Cittie of London, as they stand in (the uppermost
North Window of) our Lady Church at Andwerp,
in which Church windowes stand the effigies of King
Edward the Third, and all his children; with most
of the Armes of the Corporate Townes of England
at that tyme; and this standeth first, and hath an ould
Roman L in the first quarter, which John Stowe
tooke in an ould seale which he had seene, for a
sword, afferminge thereby that it was the Sworde of
St. Paule, patron of the saide Cittie: whereby he
constantly affermed that they had aunciently soe
borne it, and that it was no reward giuen by King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Richard the Second, as our Chronicles reporte, for
the seruice done in Smythfieeld against Watt Tyler
y<sup>e</sup> Rebell, by William Wallworth, Maior of London,
whoe slewe the sayd Tyler with his dagger; in
memory whereof, say they, the dagger was added to
the Cittie’s Armes.’ This passage you will find in two
ancient Manuscript copies of Heraldical Collections
for London, in the Harleian Library, No. 1464,
page 1; and No. 1349, page 2&#8201;b; attended by sketches
of the ancient and modern bearings, drawn in pen and
ink, technically called <cite>Tricks of Arms</cite>. This same
story, told in the very same words, with two rude
sketches of the Arms in the margin, is also to be
found in one of Philpott’s Manuscripts, in the Library
at the Heralds’ College, marked P b. No. 22,
page 10&#8201;a; where it is written on paper, in an ancient
running hand about the year 1602; and, what is extremely
singular, there does not appear to be any
other entry of the City Arms in the books of that
Office.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding, however, as Strype tells us, in
his most interesting ‘<cite>Life of John Stow</cite>,’ prefixed to
his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 15, that the worthy old
Citizen, and Master Rouge Dragon, were well acquainted,
and communicated their labours to each
other, yet he says also, that Stow would not be persuaded
concerning the Dutch blazon of the London
Arms, but affirmed them to have been always the
same. I have but two other proofs to bring forward
concerning these bearings; and then I will no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
trespass upon your long-tried patience, but return back
with all speed to our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">memorabilia</i> of London Bridge.</p>

<p>“The first of these is, that in Mr. J. B. Nichols’s
‘<cite>Brief Account of the Guildhall of the City of
London</cite>,’ London, 1819, octavo, we are told, at
page 34, that in the Eastern Crypt of that building,
the groinings of the roof meet in bosses carved with
Armorial Ensigns; some being those of King Edward
the Confessor, and others those of the City of London.
‘It is worthy of remark,’ adds the Author of this
volume, in the same place, ‘that the Arms of London
represented in the bosses on the side aisles <em>have</em> the
dagger, while all those in the centre aisle are <em>without</em>
it.’ I will make no other commentary upon this,
than, that part of the crypt is said to have been built
antecedent to the reign of King Richard II., or, probably,
formed part of the ancient Guildhall, erected,
as some suppose, in 1189; the present building being
commenced, as Stow tells us in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 558, in 1411, during the reign of Henry IV.
The last evidence which I have to cite on this subject,
is a small, but rare tract in the British Museum, entitled
‘<cite>The Citie’s Advocate in this Case, or Question
of Honour and Armes; whether Apprenticeship extinguisheth
Gentry?</cite>’ London, 1629, 4to. The Author
of this volume is supposed to have been that John
Philipot, or Philpott, whom I before mentioned, who
was created Somerset Herald, on July the 8th, 1624,
and who died on the 25th of November, 1645. He
engraves both the banner of St. Paul, supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
an effigy of Robert Fitz-Walter, and the Arms as
they are now borne, for the Ensigns of London; and
states that they were ‘a copy of that which an old
imperfect larger volume at the Office of Armes containeth.’
He cites this record in proof of Stow’s
veracity in explaining the weapon to signify the
Sword of St. Paul; and adds that his effigy as ‘titularie
patron of London, aduanced itself into the
standard, and upon the shield were those well-known
armories of the crosse and weapon.’ It is, perhaps,
almost unworthy of mention, that Edward Hatton,
in his ‘<cite>New View of London</cite>,’ London, 1708, 8vo.,
volume i., in the inscription to the frontispiece representing
the City Arms, blazons them ‘Argent, a
Cross Gules: on y<sup>e</sup> 1st quarter a sword (by some
falsly called y<sup>t</sup> of St. Paul, by others y<sup>e</sup> dagger of
Sr. Wm. Walworth; but I take it to represent y<sup>t</sup> of
Justice) of y<sup>e</sup> 2nd:’ this idea, however, is without
the slightest support either in reason, history, research,
or heraldry. Such is the chief evidence now extant
concerning our Civic Ensigns, which you will find
very fully and wittily considered, by a learned and
facetious gentleman, an intimate of mine, in a paper
signed R. S., printed in a periodical of much merit,
entitled the ‘<cite>New European Magazine</cite>,’ volume iv.,
May, 1824, pages 397-401.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barnaby Postern,” said I, as I concluded
this discourse on our Civic Heraldry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> “I have spoken
somewhat at length on this subject, partly on account
of its great interest, and partly because you ever
and anon remind me of the sentiment uttered by
that talkative knave, <em>Gratiano</em>, in the ‘<cite>Merchant of
Venice</cite>;’ who says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc">But, as we have now gotten through our wanderings
for the present, let me recall to your mind that our
Bridge history was brought down to the period
when&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To the time,” interrupted the Antiquary, “when
the prompt courage and prudence of the youthful
Richard, after the death of the rebel Tyler, the
valour of the famous Henry Spencer, Bishop of
Norwich, and the united efforts of the King’s Armies
and Councils, had succeeded in putting an end to
one of the most extensive and dangerous insurrections
ever known in England. During these turbulent
times at home, the King’s Ambassadors abroad had
been vainly endeavouring to negociate a marriage
between their Sovereign, and a daughter of the Duke
of Milan. On the failure of which negociation, he
demanded the hand of Anne of Luxemburg, daughter
of the Emperor Charles IV., and sister to Wenceslaus,
Emperor and King of Bohemia; with whom, on May
the 2nd, 1381, his marriage was formally concluded
at Nuremburg. I mention this only to remind you,
to whom the Pageants were presented which I shall
very speedily have to notice. Before, however, that
we arrive at any events so entertaining as these, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
must mention some other circumstances, and repeat
to you another extract from a Patent Roll concerning
the appointment of a Gate-Keeper to London Bridge,
recorded in the eighth Year of King Richard II.,
A. D. 1385., Membrane the 22nd. It is addressed,
‘For Walter Fesecock,’ and in English runs in the
following terms; the original Latin being printed in
Hearne’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger</cite>,’ volume i., page *486.</p>

<p>“‘The King to all to whom these presents shall
come,&mdash;Greeting. Know ye, that of our special grace,
and for the good service of our beloved Walter Fesecock,
one of our Bargemen, we grant to the same
Walter, for as much as in us lieth, the Officer of Gate-keeper
of the Bridge of our City of London; he
being near to us, and paying to us a price not exceeding
thirteen shillings and four pence by the
year: that is to say, he is to have the said office, with
the profits belonging thereto, for the term of his life;
in the manner that John Chese, deceased, had the
office aforesaid, by the grant of our most dear Lord
and grandfather deceased. In testimony of which
thing, Witness the King, at Westminster, on the
eighth day of April. By Writ of Privy Seal.’</p>

<p>“I am next, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, to speak of
a famous action on London Bridge, which most authors
who have written the history of that edifice, place
five or six, and some even eight, years later, than it
really happened; which I cannot imagine to have
arisen from any other cause, than that of their carelessly
following each other, or else copying Stow, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ page 61, without turning to the original
ancient Author, whom he cites in the margin of his
‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ pages 312-313, as his authority for the fact.
This memorable exhibition was a solemn Justing
between an English and a Scottish Knight, as a
display of the valour of their different countries;
which was held on St. George’s day, the 23d of
April, 1390; and not, as Stow has most unaccountably
stated, in the works which I have quoted, either in
1395 or 1396. The authorities with which I shall
support my argument, are ancient, and some of them
even contemporary; but we will first relate the plain
story from the elegant Latin of Hector Boethius,
a Scottish Historian, who was born at Dundee in
1470: the best edition of whose ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scotorum Histori&aelig;</cite>’
is that printed at Paris in folio, 1575; where, on
page 335&#8201;b, the passage commencing ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Durante inter
Anglos Scotosque pace publica</i>,’ is, in English, to the
following effect.</p>

<p>“‘During the general peace between the Scots
and the English, many of the English, who were of
Knightly rank, and who excelled in military arts and
prowess, frequented Scotland, and there also came
many Scots into England; producing, on both parts,
many honourable tournaments, to which mutual challenges
were published. Of these feats, the most
worthy of memory was accounted that victory on
London Bridge, by David Lindesay, Earl of Crawfurd.
An Englishman, the Lord Wells, was then the Ambassador
of King Richard, in Scotland, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
attending at a solemn banquet, where many persons,
both Scots and English, were discoursing upon courage
and arms. ‘Away with this strife of words,’ said
the Englishman; ‘whoever would experience the
valour of the English, let his name be declared, and
also a time and place be appointed, wherever ye list,
for a single passage of arms, and I am ready. I call
on thee,’ said he to David, ‘who hast spent many
words against me, and thou shalt have to just with me
rather than all the rest.’ ‘Yea, truly,’ said David,
‘and I will do it blithely, if thou canst bring the King
to consent to it.’ The King agreeing, the Englishman
made choice of the place, and, because it should
be in another country, he selected London Bridge:
David named the time, the holy St. George’s day,
because he was the chief patron of soldiers. Thereupon
the Lord Wells returned to London, and David
provided himself with arms, as well as he might. As
the day was approaching, he made a journey with
thirty-two persons in his train, immediately to London,’&mdash;this,
however, is an error, for there were but
twenty-nine in all, as I shall presently shew,&mdash;‘coming
to King Richard, who received them with great
honour.’</p>

<p>“Of the actual time when Sir David Lindsay came
to England to engage in this passage of arms, we
have the most authentic proof, in the original writs
granted for his safe conduct, which are yet extant in
that interesting body of Scots’ Records, entitled
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Scoti&aelig;</cite>,’ or the Rolls of Scotland. These invaluable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
historical documents contain,&mdash;says the Rev.
Thomas Hartwell Horne, in his excellent notices of
them attached to the printed copies, published by the
Commissioners of the Public Records, London, 1819,
folio, volume ii., page 7,&mdash;‘an important collection
of Records, illustrative of the Political Transactions
between England and Scotland.’ They commence
with the nineteenth year of King Edward I.&mdash;A. D.
1290,&mdash;and terminate with the eighth year of
King Henry VIII.&mdash;1516. With the exception of
two Rolls of 1339 and 1360, the 13th and 34th of
Edward III., which are in the Chapter House at
Westminster, all the remainder are deposited in the
Wakefield Tower, in the Tower of London. The
character in which they are written, of course, varies
according to the different reigns, but it is, in general,
a small and clear current Court-hand, with a moderate
proportion of contractions; and their contents are
composed of Treaties, Ransoms, Attainders, Grants,
Licenses, and Passes of Safe Conduct for persons
during war, some of which I am about to mention
to you, as being proof of the Justing on London
Bridge, in 1390. In the Second Volume then of the
printed ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Scoti&aelig;</cite>,’ page 103, Column 1; or on
Membrane 3 of the original Roll of the 13th of
Richard II.,&mdash;1389-90 you will find the first of these
instruments, a translation of which runs thus.</p>

<p>“‘Safe conduct for David de Lyndesey, Knight,
for the duel to be fought with John de Welles.</p>

<p>‘The King to all and singular, our Sheriffs, Mayors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Bailiffs, Ministers, and faithful subjects, within and
without our liberties, to whom these present letters
shall come, Greeting. Know ye, that because our
beloved and faithful John de Welles,&mdash;for the perfecting
of a certain Passage of Arms within our
Kingdom of England, against David de Lyndeseye,
of Scotland, Knight, as he appears to have been
calumniated by the said David,&mdash;he is petitioner to
us for the security of the said David, with his followers
and servants coming into our Kingdom aforesaid,
for the cause aforesaid, and graciously to provide
for their remaining here, and returning again to their
own country. We therefore, inclined at the supplication
and urgent request of our liegemen who are at this
time assisting to us, do undertake for the coming of
the said David, <em>with twenty and nine persons of
his company and retinue, in armour, David himself
being in the said number</em>, and twelve other Knights,
with their Esquires, Varlets, and Pages also accounted,
and with thirty horses, into our kingdom
aforesaid, for the completing of the aforesaid Passage
of Arms with the said John, from the sixth day of
May next approaching; for the coming of the same,
and for their cause of remaining, and for their going
out and returning to their own parts: nevertheless
upon condition, that if any of the aforesaid who may
be outlaws to us or our kingdom, shall present themselves
in our Kingdom aforesaid, under the colour
and protection of the company of David, they shall
not enter nor remain in our safe and secure conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
We will also, that the said David be sufficiently
armed for himself: with trusses’&mdash;most probably
couches, or beds&mdash;‘for himself, and also during the
completing of the Passage of Arms aforesaid, to carry,
conduct, and have such with him, to be used for him
upon any attack. And therefore we command you, and
all of you whatsoever, that the said David, with his
men, arms, and horses aforesaid, with all their
harness coming into our Kingdom aforesaid, in the
manner and for the cause aforesaid, is, in remaining
here, and in returning to his own country, to be in
friendship, protection, and defence; not bringing upon
them, nor permitting to be brought upon them, any
injury, molestation, damage, or grievance. In testimony
of which, this shall last from the first day of
April next to come, for the two months then immediately
following; to be accounted from the first day
of the same. Witness the King, at Westminster, the
twenty-second day of January. By Letter of Privy
Seal.’</p>

<p>“And now, Sir, let us suppose the parapet of
London Bridge decorated with rich hangings of tapestry
and cloth of gold, such as we know it was
customary to adorn those edifices with on occasions
of rejoicing and triumph. The lists for a Justing,
you remember, were sixty paces in length, by forty
in breadth, but as the whole width of the Bridge
was but forty feet, this rule, though made by Thomas,
Duke of Gloucester, Uncle to Richard II., the King
in whose reign we now are, must have been dispensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with; for, estimating the pace at two feet and an
half, the measurement amounts to 150 feet by 100.
The ground within the lists was to be paved with
large stones, hard, level, and firm; and the entrances,
which were commonly erected East and West, were
to be fenced with bars, seven feet, or more, in height,
that a horse might not be able to leap over them. At
either end of the lists were erected the tents of the
tilters, having their shields suspended over the entrances;
which it was also customary to hang up
at the windows of the houses where they lodged,
at once to denote their residence, and to declare their
Knightly intentions. We find, however, in that very
curious and sumptuous work by Dr. Samuel Rush
Meyrick, entitled ‘<cite>A Critical Enquiry into Ancient
Armour</cite>,’ London, 1824, folio, volume ii., page 59,
<em>Note</em>, that he supposes that the lists for this Justing
upon London Bridge, were without the centre paling
between the Knights, called, in France, the double
Lists, because, he imagines, one of the champions
was overthrown by the concussion of their steeds.</p>

<p>“We will, however, now return to the account of
this Justing given by Boethius; ‘When the day of
battle was come,’ continues he, ‘both parties being
armed, were most honourably conducted to the Bridge,
which was filled in all parts with noble spectators,
with whom Richard was seated in an eminent place;
though a great concourse of the common people also
was collected, excited by the novelty of the event,
and the fame of the champions. The signal being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
given, tearing their barbed horses with their spurs,
they rushed hastily together with a mighty force, and
with square-ground spears, to the conflict. Neither
party was moved by the vehement impulse and
breaking of the spears; so that the common people
affected to cry out that David was bound to the saddle
of his horse, contrary to the law of arms, because he
sat unmoved, amidst the splintering of the lances on
his helmet and visage. When Earl David heard this,
he presently leaped off his charger, and then as
quickly vaulted again upon his back without any
assistance; and, taking a second hasty course, the
spears were a second time shivered by the shock,
through their burning desire to conquer. And now
a third time were these valorous enemies stretched out
and running together: but then the English Knight
was cast down breathless to the earth, with great
sounds of mourning from his countrymen that he was
killed. Earl David, when victory appeared, hastened
to leap suddenly to the ground; for he had fought
without anger, and but for glory, that he might shew
himself to be the strongest of the champions, and
casting himself upon Lord Wells, tenderly embraced
him until he revived, and the surgeon came to attend
him. Nor, after this, did he omit one day to visit
him in the gentlest manner during his sickness, even
like the most courteous companion. He remained
in England three months by the King’s desire, and
there was not one person of nobility who was not
well-affected towards him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“This extended residence of Sir David Lindsay in
England, is also proved by a renewal of his safe
conduct, which was granted him in the following
terms; the original instrument being recorded on
Membrane 3 of the Roll for the Year already mentioned;
and a copy is inserted on page 104, column 1,
of the printed edition of the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli Scoti&aelig;</cite>.’</p>

<p>“‘Renewal of the Safe Conduct of David de
Lyndeseye, Knight.</p>

<p>‘The King to all and singular the Sheriffs, Mayors,
Bailiffs, Officers, and our faithful subjects within and
without our liberties, to whom these present letters
shall come, Greeting. Know ye, that David de
Lyndeseye of Scotland, Knight, hath lately come, by
authority of our safe conduct into our Kingdom, for
the perfecting of some certain passages of arms within
the same, with nine and twenty persons in his company
and retinue, David himself being of their
number; and because he yet appears in our said
Kingdom, and purposes for a short space of time to
remain and continue within our Kingdom, some certain
impediment and affairs of great importance
touching his own person being in the mean while
to be concluded: We, at the immediate request of
David himself, to whom we are at this time graciously
inclined, do undertake for the remaining of the said
David, with the aforesaid twenty and nine persons of
his society and retinue, David himself being accounted
of their number, with their horses and
harness, for the matter aforesaid; and afterwards for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
their returning into their own parts under our safe
and secure conduct. Nevertheless, upon condition
that if any traitors to us or our Kingdom, or any
outlaws from the same, present them in our Kingdom
under pretence and protection of David’s company,
they shall not enter nor remain therein. We will
also, however, that the said David be sufficiently
armed, with trusses for his own person, for the perfecting
of the aforesaid passage of arms, to carry,
conduct, and have with him, to be used for him upon
any attack whatsoever. And therefore we will and
command you, and all of you, that the said David,
with his men, arms, and horses aforesaid, with all
their harness, in our Kingdom, in the manner and for
the cause aforesaid, is, in remaining, and afterwards
in returning to his own countries, to be in friendship,
protection, and defence,’ &amp;c. as before. ‘In testimony
of which, these presents shall last for the two months
immediately following. Witness the King at Westminster,
on the thirteenth day of May. By the
King himself.’</p>

<p>“That I may the better complete the narrative of
this Knight’s residence in England, I will yet give you
the translations of two writs more, recorded on the
Second Membrane of the same Roll, and printed
upon the same page as the last, Column 2.</p>

<p>“‘Another Renewal of the same Safe Conduct.</p>

<p>‘The King by his Letters Patents, which shall last
from the first day of June next to come, for the two
months then immediately ensuing, to be accounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
from the first day of the same, undertakes for his
safe and secure conduct, and for the King’s special
protection and defence to David Lyndesey, of Scotland,
Knight, coming into the King’s realm of England,
with twenty and nine persons of his company
and retinue, David himself being accounted in their
number, to be confirmed in Towns by virtue of the
license of the Mayors, Bailiffs, and Keepers of the
same, on his entering and returning towards the
countries of Scotland, with his familiar people, their
horses, harness, and all goods whatsoever. Witness
the King, at Westminster, on the twenty-fifth day of
May. By Bill of Privy Seal.’</p>

<p>“We have lastly, in the following warrant, an authentic
notice of his departure for Scotland.</p>

<p>“‘Safe Conduct for the Scottish Ship for the carriage
of the Armour of David Lyndesey.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>‘The King by his Letters Patents, which shall last
from the first day of June next to come, for the two
months then immediately ensuing, to be accounted
from the first day of the same, engages for his safe
and secure conduct, and for his special protection and
defence to a certain vessel of Scotland, called Seinte
Marie, Ship of Dundee, whereof William Snelle is
Master, with twelve Mariners crossing the seas for
trading, the said Master and Mariners not carrying
with them any property or goods whatsoever, nor any
illicit goods, or prohibited merchandise, out of the
Kingdom of the King aforesaid, excepting only one
complete Armour of War for the body of David
Lyndesey of Scotland, Knight. Witness the King,
at Westminster, the twenty-fifth day of May. By
Letter of Privy Seal.’</p>

<p>“Such, then, are the particulars of this memorable
event, as related by Boethius, and supported by
proofs from the most undoubted records, which fix it
in the Year 1390; illustrated also by the addition of
some curious particulars from Stow’s translation of
the passage given in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ which I have already
cited; though it is far beyond my ability to
give you either the elegance or strength of expression,
which the original author has infused into his narrative.
Now, for the time when this Justing took place,
let me observe that Boethius does not mention any year;
Stow has called it 1395 and 1396; Raphael Holinshed,
who professed to have translated the Scottish Historian
in the Second part of his ‘<cite>Chronicles of England, Scotland,
and Ireland</cite>,’ London, 1585-86, volume i., page
252, makes it 1398; and James Howell, whose account
of London Bridge is a verbatim reprint of
Stow’s, in his ‘<cite>Londinopolis</cite>,’ London, 1657, folio,
page 22, sets it down as 1381. So far, then, all are at
variance: but these are only the later and English
Authors; whilst, on the other hand, we have the
following positive assurance of John de Fordun, a
Scottish Priest, who is said in 1377 to have dedicated
his History of Scotland to the Cardinal Walter Wardlaw,
Bishop of Glasgow; the best edition of whose work,
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Johannis de Fordun Scotichronicon</cite>,’ with the Continuation
of Walter Bower, Abbot of St. Columb’s Isle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in 1424, is that of Walter Goodall, Edinburgh, 1759,
folio; where, in volume ii., book xv., chapter iv., page
422, is the passage to which I have alluded. ‘In the
same year, and on the 21st of the month,’&mdash;it commences,
these being 1390, and April,&mdash;‘the Lord
David Lindesay is made first Earl of Crawfurd, a
valiant Knight, and in all warlike virtues most highly
commended; who, with other proofs of them, had a
glorious triumph over the Lord Wells of England, in
his days a most famous soldier, at London, in the
presence of King Richard II., in the year 1390, in a
warlike pastime with spears: of which proof of military
prowess, the fame hath hitherto been widely celebrated
throughout England.’</p>

<p>“The next authority which I shall adduce is that of
Andrew of Wyntoun, a Scottish Chronicler, who was
Canon Regular of St. Andrews, and Prior of the Monastery
of St. Serf in Loch-leven; and who died about
the year 1420. The best edition of his labours is that
beautiful one, entitled ‘<cite>The Orygynale Cronykil of
Scotland, be Androw of Wyntown, Priowr of Sanct Serfis
Ynche</cite>,’&mdash;that is Isle,&mdash;‘<cite>in Loch levyn. Now first
published with Notes and a Glossary, by David Macpherson</cite>,’
London, 1815, 8vo., 2 volumes. In the Second
Volume of this work then, at page 353, the commencement
of Chapter xi. reads thus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>“This Author, indeed, never mentions London
Bridge, and assigns a different day for the encounter,
as we read in the verses on the next page.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Sw&agrave; ewyn a-pon <em>the sext day</em><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“We have, however, sufficient authority for believing
that this Justing did actually take place on St.
George’s day, for Hector Boethius states, on page 336&#8201;b.
of his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ that because it was through the protection
of St. George, on whose day Sir David, or
rather Earl, Lindsay fought, he had gained this victory,
he founded a Chantry, with a gift of 48 marks,&mdash;&pound;32
yearly,’&mdash;for seven Priests, with divers Virgins, for
ever to sing holy Anthems to the Saintly Soldier in
the Church of Dundee. ‘The which,’ adds he, ‘they
did unto our time,’&mdash;that is, about eighty years afterwards&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>‘not
without singular commendations to the
Earl.’</p>

<p>“The Poem also speaks of the use of other weapons
than lances; and gives both Sir David Lindsay and
King Richard a less degree of courtesy than we find
mentioned elsewhere, as you will discover in the following
passage.</p>

<p>“Let <em>me</em> finish this story, Mr. Postern,” said I, as
he concluded his repetition of these old Scottish
verses; “if it <em>be</em> to have a finish, and you do not
really intend to keep me all night in the year 1390<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
for we must not, certainly, let two such champions
pass without one word concerning their families and
their Arms; nor leave without distinction the actual Sir
David Lindsay, and Lord Wells, who were engaged
in this very famous passage of arms. You must, I
am sure, remember, Mr. Barnaby, that the immortal
Sir William Dugdale, Garter King of Arms, hath,
in his ‘<cite>Baronage of England</cite>,’ London, 1676, folio,
volume ii., page 11, a memoir of Lord Wells, very meet
to be mentioned here. His Lordship was the descendant
of Adam de Welles, who lived in the time of
Richard I. and he had served in the wars in Flanders,
France, and Scotland, under the Kings Edward III.,
and Richard II., and the valiant John, Duke of Lancaster.
As he was ten years old at his father’s death in
1360, he must have been about forty when he justed on
London Bridge; and after having been summoned to
Parliament from 1376 to 1420, he is supposed to have
died in the following year, on the Tuesday next after
the Feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, which
being Sunday, August the 24th, 1421, made it the
26th of the month. Andrew of Wyntown, whom you
have quoted, says of this Lord, you remember, in
his Chronicle, volume ii., page 354, alluding to the
Justing on London Bridge:&mdash;</p>

queu&eacute;e, Sable. Of Sir David Lindsay, of Glenesk,
commonly called Earl of Crawfurd, you may see
some notices with proofs, in ‘<cite>The Peerage of Scotland</cite>,’
by Sir Robert Douglas, Edited by John Philip
Wood, Esq., Edinburgh, 1813, folio, volume i., page
375. He married Catherine, fifth daughter of
Robert II., King of Scotland, and his brother-in-law,
Robert III., created him Earl of Crawfurd, April 21st,
1398; though Hector Boethius, on page 336&#8201;b of his
‘<cite>History</cite>,’ denies this, saying:&mdash;‘There are who
write, that the before-named David was created the
first Earl of Craufurd by King Robert the Third;
but because we discover by the witness of ancient
volumes, that James his father,’&mdash;rather his uncle,
who was created Baron of Crawfurd, January 1st,
1382,&mdash;‘was made Earl by Robert the Second, we
have followed a different manner in the history of
this family.’ Earl David was, however, twice a Commissioner
and Ambassador to England, in 1404 and
1406; and it is probable that he died before 1412.
The arms borne by the Lindsays were Gules, a fesse
Chequ&eacute; Argent and Azure; but his victorious banner
has long since fallen a prey to a mightier conqueror:
the lance and the falchion which struck down all
before them, have been in their turn overcome by
slow-consuming decay: the champion himself lives
but in these scattered fragments; remembered only
by descendants, or antiquaries; his tomb, and that of
his rival, are alike unknown, and even if they could
be traced,&mdash;</p>

<p>I must own that I thought it a little uncivil in Mr.
Barnaby Postern, as I finished these reflections with
an air of great philosophical wisdom, to give a short
dry cough, push the tankard towards me, and then
to say, “Sorrow is dry, Mr. Geoffrey, and morality
is musty; so do you take another draught of the
sack, and I’ll give you another chapter from the
Chronicles of London Bridge.”</p>

<p>“And now, Sir,” recommenced my visitor, “that
our history may not be without the mention of at
least one strange fish, connected with London Bridge,
let me tell you, that on Christmas day in the year
1391, as Stow tells us in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 30&#8201;b, ‘a
Dolphin came forth of the Sea, and played himself in
the Thames at London to the Bridge; foreshewing,
happily, the tempests that were to follow within
a weeke after; the which Dolphin being seene of
Citizens, and followed, was, with much difficulty, intercepted
and brought againe to London, shewing a
spectacle to many of the height of his body, for he
was tenne foote in length. These Dolphins are fishes
of the sea, that follow the voices of men, and reioyce
in playing of instruments, and are wont to gather
themselves at musick. These, when they play in
rivers, with hasty springings or leapings, doe signifie
tempests to follow. The seas containe nothing more
swift nor nimble, for oftentimes with their skips, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
mount ouer the sailes of ships.’ The original of this
story is to be found, with many more particulars concerning
Dolphins, in the ‘<cite>Historia Brevis</cite>,’ of Thomas
Walsingham, London, 1574, folio, the admirable edition
by Archbishop Parker, page 380.</p>

<p>“As the political troubles which succeeded the
appearance of this monster, were productive of a very
sumptuous triumph upon London Bridge, I shall take
the freedom to remind you, that King Richard being
greatly attached to regal magnificence and banquets,
naturally found his revenues very insufficient to
support the splendours of his Court; for, as Walsingham
and Knyghton, the best historians of the time,
assert, he valued himself upon surpassing all the other
Sovereigns of Europe in magnificence; they add that
he daily entertained no less than six thousand individuals;
that three hundred servants were employed in
his kitchen alone; and that his Queen had an equal
number of females in her service. To supply the
means for this extraordinary splendour, he endeavoured
to procure aid from the Citizens of London;
and sent to borrow from them the large sum of
&pound;1000; but it then was an unhappy time in England,
for a dreadful Plague and Famine had overspread the
land, and they not only refused his Majesty’s request,
but, upon a Merchant of Lombardy offering to comply
with it, they violently attacked, and almost slew him.
This was early in the year 1392; and on the 25th of
May following, the King, incensed to a very great
degree, summoned a Parliament at Stamford, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the City Charter was seized; the Law Courts were
removed to York; and the Mayor, Sheriffs, and principal
Citizens, deposed and imprisoned; until, by the
mediation of Queen Anne, the Bishop of London, and
the Duke of Gloucester, the King’s anger was in some
degree pacified, and he consented to indulge the
Londoners with an audience at Windsor. At this
interview the Citizens, after submitting themselves to
the King’s pleasure, offered him &pound;10,000 for the redemption
of their privileges; but were dismissed in
dejection and uncertainty; though when Richard was
informed of their sorrow, he determined to proceed
immediately to London, to re-assure them of his
favour. It was upon this occasion, that the Bridge
bore a very important part in the triumph; though the
ceremony of receiving the King and Queen with
great splendour and a considerable train, began at
Wandsworth; where four hundred of the Citizens well
mounted, and habited in one livery, entreated him
to ride through his Chamber of London. At St.
George’s Church, in Southwark, the procession was
met by Robert Braybrooke, Bishop of London, and his
Clergy of the City, followed by five hundred boys in
surplices, who attended them through the streets
towards Westminster. When the train arrived at the
Gate of London Bridge, nearly the whole of the inhabitants,
orderly arranged according to their age, rank,
and sex, advanced to receive it, and presented the
King with a fair milk-white steed, harnessed and
caparisoned in cloth of gold, brocaded in red and white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and hung full of silver bells; whilst to the Queen
was presented a palfrey, also of white, caparisoned
likewise in white and red. The other streets of
London, too, put on all their bravery; the windows
and walls being hung with cloths of gold, silver, and
silk; the Conduit in Cheapside poured out floods of
red and white wine; a child, habited like an angel,
crowned the King and Queen with golden crowns,
from a sumptuous stage covered with performers in
rich dresses; a table of the Trinity wrought in gold,
and valued at &pound;800, was given to the King, and
another of St. Anne to his consort; and truly I know
of nothing which might so well express the splendours
of that day, as the passage with which Walsingham
concludes his notice of it. ‘There was so much
glory,’ says he, ‘so much pomp, so great variety of
divers furniture provided, that to have undertaken it
might have been a triumph to any King. For horses
and trappings, plate of gold and silver, clothes of
gold, silk, and velvet, ewers and basons of yellow
gold, gold in coin, precious stones, and jewels so
rich, excellent, and beautiful, were given to him, that
their value and price might not easily be estimated.’</p>

<p>“This gorgeous scene took place on the 29th of August,
and you will find my authorities for this account
of it in Henry Knyghton’s books ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Eventibus Angli&aelig;</cite>,’
printed in Twysden’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scriptores</cite>,’ already cited,
page 2740; in Robert Fabyan’s ‘<cite>Chronicles of England
and Fraunce</cite>,’ London, 1559, folio, volume ii.,
page 334; in Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 307; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., page 180. I will but
observe, to finish this portion of history, that the
Citizens redeemed their Charter by the payment of
&pound;10,000; and the King, by his Letters Patent, dated
at Westminster, in February 1392-93, restored them
to his favour; and so, observes Stow in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’
‘the troubles of the Citizens came to quietnesse;
which troubles, the Dolphin in the Thames at Christmas
last past, did happily signifie afar off.’ Though
Maitland, at page 180 of his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i.,
most unaccountably makes the Dolphin appear the
Christmas <em>after</em> this fine was paid.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely imagine, worthy Mr. Barbican,
what could induce the accurate Stow,&mdash;and of course
all other Authors of London history,&mdash;to remark,
when speaking of the year 1395, our next eminent
epoch in the Chronicles of London Bridge, that,
because the Justing which we have already spoken of
was, as he says, then holden upon it, such ‘history
proveth that at that time, the Bridge being coaped on
either side, was not replenished with houses built
thereupon, as since it hath been, and now is.’ You
will observe that this passage, which occurs in
volume i., page 61, of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ is no interpolation
of later, or more unskilful, Editors, because it is to be
found in the first black-letter edition of that most
valuable work, 1598, small folio. Now, in most of
his preceding pages he has been giving proofs of the
Bridge being built upon at an early period to some
extent; and I also, after him and others, have adduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to you abundant evidence that such was the
case. I have shewn that the Gate and Towers were
certainly as ancient as 1264; that in the Patent granted
to Isenbert of Xainctes, in 1201, it is stated ‘that
the rents and profits of the several houses, which the
said Master of the Schools shall cause to be erected
on the Bridge, shall be for ever appropriated to repair,
maintain, and uphold the same;’ that in the Patent
of relief granted by Edward I., in 1280, it is observed
that the dilapidations of the Bridge may occasion
not only its sudden fall, ‘but also the destruction of
innumerable people dwelling on it;’ and that in the
reign of the same Edward, the Assize Rolls mention the
very rents and situations of houses then standing on
London Bridge. All this, I imagine, might be received
as fair and conclusive evidence that this part of the
City was built upon and inhabited, long before 1395;
to which let me add, that Richard Bloome, one of the
continuators of Stow, observes, on page 62, when
speaking of the dreadful conflagration of the Bridge
in 1632-33, that some of the houses remained unbuilt
until the year 1666, when the Great Fire of London
destroyed all the new edifices. ‘But,’ rejoins he,
‘the old ones at the South end, some of which were
built in the reign of King John,’&mdash;and he died, you
will remember in 1215,&mdash;‘were not burnt.’ It is,
however, extremely probable, that London Bridge
did not even in 1395 present that form of a continued
street which was afterward its most celebrated and
peculiar character. There were, I doubt not, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
places open to the water, perhaps, as Stow says,
‘plainly coped with stone;’ and in one of these, it is
most probable, that the Justing, which he erroneously
mentions in that year, took place.</p>

<p>“Anne of Bohemia, the Queen of Richard II.,
dying in 1394, his sorrow for her loss was both
passionately expressed, and deservedly bestowed;
though, so early afterwards as in 1396, during an
interview between him and that insane Monarch,
Charles VI. of France, a truce was concluded betwixt
the two Kingdoms for twenty-eight years, and
Richard espoused Isabel, the French King’s eldest
daughter, although she was then under eight years
of age; whence she was called ‘The Little,’ and the
English Sovereign was about thirty. This marriage
was solemnized by Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of
Canterbury, in the Church of St. Nicholas, at Calais,
on Wednesday, October the 31st, or rather the 1st of
November, when Richard is said to have expended
on the occasion, the immense sum of three hundred
thousand marks, or in modern coinage &pound;200,000. On
the 2nd of November they sailed for England, and
on arriving at Blackheath the Royal train was met by
the usual procession of the Mayor and Aldermen of
London, habited in scarlet, who attended the King to
Newington, where he dismissed them, as he was to
rest for a short time at Kennington. On the 13th,
however, Richard and his Consort entered the City on
their way to the Tower; when so vast a multitude
was collected on London Bridge to see the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Queen pass, that nine persons were killed in the
crowd, of whom the Prior of the Austin Canons at
Tiptree, in Essex, was one, and a worshipful matron
of Cornhill was another. John Stow is commonly
cited as the authority for this circumstance, and it
may be seen related in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 315;
though it is also to be found in ‘<cite>The Chronicle of
Fabian</cite>,’ London, 1559, small folio, page 338. Robert
Fabian, as you must well remember, was, in 1493, an
eminent Merchant and Sheriff of London, and died
in 1512, about thirteen years previously to the birth
of John Stow. You will also see the following notice
of the event in the Harleian Manuscripts, No. 565,
article 5, page 61&#8201;a, which consists of ‘<cite>A Chronicle
of English Affairs, and especially of those relating to
the City of London, from the first year of King
Richard I., 1189, to the 21st of Henry VI., 1442,
inclusive</cite>’&mdash;‘In yis yere, a bouzte y<sup>e</sup> feste of Alhalwen,
Isabell y<sup>e</sup> Kynges doughter of Fraunce was
spoused to Kyng Richard at Caleys: whiche afterward
on y<sup>e</sup> viij day of Januer was crowned Quene at

Typtre in Essex, with other viij persones vp on
London bregge in y<sup>e</sup> gret prees weren crowsed to
y<sup>e</sup> deth.’ Now, as I shall hereafter frequently, have to
cite this Chronicle for some particulars of events not
to be found in any other Annals, I must observe that
it is a small quarto, fairly written on parchment, in
a current Court-hand of the time of Edward IV.,
and decorated with vermillion lines and ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was, you will recollect, in 1397, that Thomas
of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, and uncle to
Richard II., being charged with disaffection and conspiracy,
was suddenly carried to Calais; in which confinement
and exile he died, on the 24th of September
in the same year, of an apoplectic fit, as some Historians
relate, although the greater number charge
Richard with his murder, and assert that he was
smothered, or strangled: for he was rude and overbearing
in his disposition, and usually opposed the
King in most of his measures; censured his extravagant
expenditure, and on several occasions is said
to have reproached and upbraided him with great
severity of language. On these accounts is the Duke’s
death charged upon the King, and his favourites; and
you have a very curious and interesting examination
of the circumstance, in Richard Gough’s ‘<cite>History and
Antiquities of Pleshy, in the County of Essex</cite>,’ London,
1803, quarto, pages 85-123. The reign of this unfortunate
Monarch was, however, nearly at a close;
for, on the 29th of September, 1399, he resigned the
ensigns of Royalty to the Duke of Lancaster, afterwards
Henry IV., and in the formal accusation, consisting
of 33 Articles, drawn up for his deposition, in
the fourth he is charged with having caused the
murder of the Duke of Gloucester. When these accusations
were read over to Richard, and he had named
his principal advisers in each action, it was Henry
of Lancaster’s care to discover the four Knights who
actually strangled the Duke of Gloucester in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Castle of Calais; and having done so, he confined
them in four separate prisons in London, ‘and would
not,’ says Sir John Froissart, ‘have taken twenty
thousand nobles for their deliverance.’ Sir Thomas
Knolles, the Mayor, and the Citizens of London, were
next acquainted with the Articles of Deposition, and
the King’s confession concerning the four Knights;
when the crowds, which had assembled in the Guildhall,
cried out with execrations against them, and
loudly demanded their immediate condemnation. This
very speedily followed, and old London Bridge,
which has in its days witnessed so many scenes of
blood, was appointed the place for the exhibition of
their heads; but in giving you a short narrative of
this execution, we can go to no better authority than
to the Herodotus of his time, Sir John Froissart, who,
as you will doubtless recollect, was born at Valenciennes
in 1337, and was Priest, Canon, and Treasurer
of the Collegiate Church of Chimay; he died
about 1401, and his Chronicles of his own time were
compiled from the most authentic sources.</p>

<p>“The French of that part of Froissart’s Chronicles
to which I have alluded, commences ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A donc se tirerent
ensemble le Maire de Londres</i>,’ &amp;c., volume iv.,
chapter cxii.; but we shall take the excellent English
of Colonel Johnes’ translation, Hafod Press, 1803,
quarto, volume iv., pages 663-664. ‘The Mayor and
Lawyers,’ says he, ‘retired to the judgment-seat, and
the four Knights were condemned to death. They
were sentenced to be brought before the apartment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the Tower of London in which King Richard was
confined, that he might see them from the windows,
and thence drawn on sledges by horses to Cheapside,
each person separately, and there beheaded, their
heads affixed to spikes on London Bridge, and their
bodies hung upon a gibbet, and there left. When
this sentence was pronounced, they hastened to execute
it. Every thing being prepared, the Mayor of
London, and the Lords who had assisted him in this
judgment, set out from Guildhall with a large body
of people, and came to the Tower of London, where
they seized the four Knights of the King, Sir Bernard
Brocas, the Lord Marclais, Master John Derby, Receiver
of Lincoln, and the Lord Stelle, Steward of
the King’s Household. They were all brought into
the court, and each tied to two horses, in the sight
of all in the Tower, who were eye-witnesses of it as
well as the King, who was much displeased, and in
despair; for the remainder of the King’s Knights
that were with him looked for similar treatment, so
cruel and revengeful did they know the Londoners.
Without saying a word, these four were dragged from
the streets to Cheapside, and on a fishmonger’s stall
had their heads struck off, which were placed over
the Gate on London Bridge, and their bodies hung
on a gibbet. After this execution, every man retired
to his home.’</p>

<p>“The fatal tragedy of the reign of King Richard II.
was at length consummated by his murder at Pontefract
Castle, February 14th, 1399-1400; for whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
he died of grief, starvation, or by the weapon of Sir
Piers Exton, his death cannot be called by any other
name; though Henry of Lancaster was not yet so firmly
seated on the throne as to prevent numerous insurrections
throughout the realm, on behalf of the younger
Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, the legitimate
heir to the crown. For about the year 1386, King
Richard had appointed as his successor Roger Mortimer,
the son of Edmond, second Earl of March,
and Philippa his Countess, who was daughter and
heiress to Lionel, Duke of Clarence, <em>third</em> son of King
Edward III.: whereas Henry of Lancaster was the
son of John of Ghent, who was only <em>fourth</em> son of
that Monarch. One of the most famous of these insurrections,
was that raised by Henry Percy, Earl
of Northumberland, which was overthrown by Sir
Thomas Rokeby, Sheriff of York, at Horselwood, on
February the 19th, 1407-1408. In which encounter,
Lord Thomas Bardolf,&mdash;who is a character in Shakspeare’s
‘<cite>Second Part of King Henry the Fourth</cite>,’&mdash;was
mortally wounded, and died soon afterwards;
but being on the party of the Earl, his body was
quartered as a traitor’s, and set up at several places,
with the Earl’s, one of which was London Bridge.
This you find identified by Thomas of Walsingham,
in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Histori&aelig; Angli&aelig;</cite>,’ page 419; for there he says,
with considerable pathos: ‘The root of Percy dies
in ruin wild! for surely this Nobleman was altogether
the living stock of the Percy name; and of most of
the various others who were lost in his defeat. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
whose unhappy end the common people did not
grieve the least; recalling that famous, glorious, and
magnificent man, and applying to him the mournful
song of Lucan, where he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘But not his blood, his wounds did not so move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our grieving souls, or wake our weeping love,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that we saw, in many a town, appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His aged head transfixed on a spear.’</span>
</div></div>

<p class="blockquot right">
<span class="smcap">Pharsalia</span>, ix. 136.
</p>

<p class="pc">For his venerable head adorned with its silver locks,
set upon a pole, was publicly carried through London,
and regardlessly placed upon the Bridge.’</p>

<p>“Sir William Dugdale, in his ‘<cite>Baronage</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 683, says that Lord Bardolf’s head was erected
over a gate at Lincoln; and this is partly supported by
the Chronicle in the Harleian Collection, No. 565, page
68&#8201;a, which states that in the ninth year of Henry IV.,
‘the Erle of Northumberland and y<sup>e</sup> Lord Bardolf,
which arysyn a yeynis y<sup>e</sup> Kyng, were taken in y<sup>e</sup>
north cuntre, and be heded, and y<sup>e</sup> hed of y<sup>e</sup> forsaid
Erle, and a quarter of y<sup>e</sup> Lord Bardolf, were sent to
London, and sett vp on London Brigge.’ Dugdale
adds, however, from the authority of the Close Rolls,
that Avicia, the widow of that Baron, was permitted
by the King to take down his body and bury it.</p>

<p>“The only historical notice which I find connected
with London Bridge, immediately succeeding the last
unhappy story, is of a light and even trivial nature,
being nothing greater than a dispute in the Bridge-Street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
between Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence,
and John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, the
second and third sons of Henry IV., their followers
and the Citizens. Stow, in relating this circumstance,
in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 338, makes no farther mention
of the place than that they ‘being in East-Cheape, in
London, at supper, after midnight, a great debate
hapned betweene their men and men of the Court,
lasting an houre, till the Maior and Sheriffs, with
other Citizens, ceased the same:’ and Maitland adds,
in volume i., of his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ page 185, that these
Officers were, in consequence, summoned before Sir
William Gascoigne, the Chief Justice, to submit
themselves to the King’s mercy on behalf of the
Citizens. Richard Marlow, however, the then Lord
Mayor, and John Law and William Chicheley, the
Sheriffs, with the Aldermen, strenuously asserted
their innocence, alleging that they had only done their
duty in preserving the peace of the City; and the
King being fully satisfied with this answer, the Corporation
returned to London. I have only farther to
remark, that Prince Thomas of Clarence was engaged
in a similar fray in East-Cheap in the year previous to
the present, namely 1407-8; and that it is to him that
Shakspeare makes the dying King Henry deliver that
noble speech in the ‘<cite>Second Part of King Henry IV.</cite>,’
Act 4, Scene 4. We derive, however, such a character
of John of Lancaster from Falstaff, that we
wonder to find him either in East-Cheap or Bridge-Street;
for in that very same dramatic history, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in the preceding scene, he says of him: ‘Good faith,
this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me;
nor a man cannot make him laugh;&mdash;but that’s no
marvel, he drinks no wine.’ Here, then, close all the
events of London Bridge which have come under my
reading, in the year 1409.</p>

<p>“The Festival of St. Mary Magdalen, July 22nd,
in the first year of Henry V., A. D. 1413, brings to
us the recollection of a very ancient and curious
Saxon law, namely that of Sanctuary: by which privilege,
if a person accused of any crime,&mdash;excepting
Treason and Sacrilege, in which the Crown and the
Church were too nearly concerned,&mdash;had fled to any
Church, or Church-Yard, and within forty days after
went before the Coroner, made a full confession of
his crime, and took the oath provided in that case,
that he would quit the realm, and never return again,
without leave of the King, his life should be safe.
At the taking of this oath he was brought to the
Church-door, where being branded with an A, signifying
Abjured, upon the brawn of the thumb of
his right hand, a port was then assigned him, from
which he was to leave the realm, and to which he
was to make all speed, holding a cross in his hand,
and not turning out of the highway, either to the
right hand or the left. At this port he was diligently
to seek for passage, waiting there but one ebb and
flood, if he could immediately procure it; and if not,
he was to go every day into the sea up to his knees,
essaying to pass over. If this could not be accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
within forty days, he was again to put himself
into Sanctuary. These privileges of Sanctuary and
Abjuration were taken away in 1624, by the Statute
of the 21st of James I., chapter 28: but you will
find the ancient law on these points fully set forth in
William Rastall’s ‘<cite>Collection in English of the Statutes
now in force</cite>,’ London, 1594, folio, under their
proper titles, folios 2&#8201;a, 399&#8201;b, and also in Andrew
Horne’s learned work of ‘<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Somme, appell&eacute; Mirroir
des Justices</cite>,’ London, 1624, 12mo., chapter 1,
section xiii., page 102. Rastall, you will recollect,
was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas under Queen
Mary; and Horne was a Lawyer of great erudition
and eminence, in the reigns of the First and Second
Edwards.</p>

<p>“Well, Sir, having brought to your remembrance
these ancient privileges, I am next to tell you that in
1413, a train of five abjurants of the realm crossed
London Bridge on their way to Calais; having issued
from a member of the famous Sanctuary of St. Martin’s
le Grand, which was founded by Ingelric, Earl
of Essex, and his brother Girardus, in 1056, and confirmed
by Pope Alexander II., and King William I.,
in 1068. For these facts I must refer you to Stow’s
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., pages 605-606; and to page 16,
&amp;c. of a modest little volume of much curious information
by Mr. Alfred John Kempe, entitled ‘<cite>Historical
Notices of the Collegiate Church, or Royal
Chapel and Sanctuary, of St. Martin’s le Grand</cite>,’ London,
1825, 8vo. As for the circumstance which caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
these worthies to fly their country, we have it set
down in the following terms, in that Chronicle contained
in the Harleian Manuscript, No. 565, folio
74&#8201;a. ‘And in the same yere, on Seynt Marie Maudeleyn
day,’&mdash;July 22nd.&mdash;‘John Nyaunser, Squyer,
and his men, sclowen Maist<sup>r</sup>. Tybbay, Clerk,’&mdash;Archdeacon
of Huntingdon, and Chancellor to Joan, Queen
of Henry IV.&mdash;‘as he passyd thorugh lad lane. For
the whiche deth the same John Nyaunser and iiij of
his men fledden in to Seynt Anne’s Chirche with inne
Aldrich gate,’&mdash;that is to say, St. Anne in the Willows,
as we now call it, though without exactly knowing
why,&mdash;‘And with inne the said Church they were
mured vp. And men of diuers wardes wacched them
nyzt and day. And y<sup>e</sup> forsaid John Nyaunser and
his men for suoren the Kynges lond, and passyd
through the Citee of London,’&mdash;on August the 21st,&mdash;‘toward
Caleys, in there schertes and breches,’&mdash;a
purse about their necks,&mdash;‘and ich of them a
cross in ther hand.’ Let me add, that you will also
find this circumstance recorded in Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’
page 345.”</p>

<p>“My worthy Mr. Postern!” exclaimed I, for I now
began to grow exceedingly impatient, “I really can
bear this no longer: you promise to give me a descriptive
history of London Bridge, and here you tell
me of nothing but a riot which took place in the
street <em>near</em> to it, and of a troop of knaves which <em>probably</em>
walked over it. Positively, my good Sir, it’s
too bad; and unless your story mend, why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘It shall be mended, Mr. Barbican,’” answered
the imperturbable Antiquary, in much the same tone
of voice as that with which <em>Lope Tocho</em> calmed the
enraged Muleteer, in the same words;&mdash;“‘It shall
be mended,’ and our Chronicles too, Mr. Geoffrey;
but sweeten your disposition, my good friend, I pray
you. Remember, that an Antiquary may <em>ruffle</em> his
shirt, but never his temper; for though I confess to
you that the collateral events which I am obliged to
introduce, are somewhat like&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Rich windows that exclude the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passages which lead to nothing:’&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">yet, when we consider how little the tooth of Time
hath left to us of continuous History, we should
labour to supply that defect by joining all the fragments
with which we meet, wherever they may be
united to the principal, but still imperfect, chain.
We are, however, now arrived at a period, which our
Bridge Historians do in general pass over, with
little information to their readers, and less labour to
themselves; yet even here, although we have no
pictorial delineations to refer to, yet, with a little
research, we have enough of descriptive story to call
up the very scenes before our eyes, and to bring the
actors again living before us.</p>

<p>“The year 1415 is not only immortalized in History
by the famous Battle of Agincourt, fought on
the 25th of October, but even in the Chronicles of
London Bridge it is a most memorable era, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of the splendid Pageants which welcomed the victorious
Henry V., as he returned over that edifice to
his Palace at Westminster. About the middle of November,
or, as some tell us, the 16th, the King embarked
for England, bringing his principal prisoners
with him; and you may remember, by the way, that
his fleet being encountered by a violent storm, two
of his ships were sunk, and all were in extreme
danger. You will find a few particulars of these
facts in Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 351, and also in that
Chronicle which I have so often quoted, in the Harleian
Manuscript, No. 565; of which latter, the following
are the words, from page 76&#8201;b.</p>

<p>“‘Also in this yere, that is to say the xxviij day
of Octobr., the Kyng com to his Town of Caleys, and
was there til y<sup>e</sup> xvj day of Nouembr. And that same
day y<sup>e</sup> King schypped fro his Town of Caleys toward
Engelond: And he landed y<sup>e</sup> same day at nyzt, at
Douerre, and com forth all y<sup>e</sup> woke after toward
London. And y<sup>e</sup> fryday at nyzt, y<sup>e</sup> King come to
Eltham, and there he lay all that nyzt; and on y<sup>e</sup>
morwe was Satyrday, y<sup>e</sup> xxiij day of Nouembr.
The Maire of London, and alle y<sup>e</sup> Aldermen, with all
y<sup>e</sup> Craftes of London, reden euery man in reed, with
hodes reed and white, and mette with y<sup>e</sup> Kyng on
y<sup>e</sup> Blake heth comyng from Eltham ward, toward
his Citee of London; and ayens his comynge was
ordeyned moche ryalte in London: that is to weten,
at London Bregge, at y<sup>e</sup> Conduyt in Cornhill, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>grete Conduyt in Chepe; and at y<sup>e</sup> Crosse in Chepe
was mad a Ryall Castell with Angells and Virgynes,
syngynge there jnne. And so y<sup>e</sup> Kyng and hise presoners
of Frensshmen reden thorugh London vn to
Westminster to mete.’</p>

<p>“It is fortunate for us Antiquaries, however, that
we have still better descriptions of these Pageants,
and especially of that exhibited on London Bridge;
and if in relating them to you, I seem to speak over
much upon one subject, I pray you to remember,
as I said, how very slightly that subject&mdash;at least so
far as concerns the Bridge,&mdash;has been treated by Historians
in general; and how many of those who have
pretended to write of this edifice, have omitted it altogether.
Give me your patience, then, whilst I translate
for you two curious accounts of those Pageants,
which welcomed King Henry into the best and the
greatest of Cities.</p>

<p>“The first which I shall cite, is, most probably,
from the pen of an eye-witness, both of the King’s
valour abroad, and of his triumphs at home; since it
is from a Latin Manuscript in the Cottonian Library,
marked <em>Julius</em>, E. IV., Article 4, which the Catalogue
at page 17 calls ‘<cite>The Acts of King Henry V.:
the Author, a Chaplain in the Royal Army, who saw
them for himself</cite>.’ This Manuscript is written on
paper, in a very small and fair current black-letter,
full of contractions; and on page 122&#8201;b, the account
of the Bridge Pageants runs thus. ‘And therewith,
about the hour of ten in the day, the King came in
the midst of them all; and the Citizens gave glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and honour to God, and many congratulations and
blessings to the King, for the victories he had brought
them, and for the public works which he had wrought;
and the King was followed by the Citizens towards
the City, with a proper, but a moderate, protection.
And for the praise and glory of the City, out of so many
magnificent acts of the noble Citizens, some things
worthy of note the pen records with applause. On
the top of the Tower at the entrance of the Bridge,
which stands, as it were, on going into the strength of
the City, there stood on high a figure of gigantic
magnitude, fearlessly looking in the King’s face, as
if he would do battle; but on his right and left hand,
were the great keys of the City hanging to a staff, as
though he had been Gate-keeper. Upon his right,
stood the figure of a woman not much less in size,
habited in the gown, tunic, and ornaments of a female,
as if they had been meant for a man and his wife,
who appeared favourers of the King, and desired that
they might see his face, and receive him with many
plaudits. And the towers about them were ornamented
with halberts and the Royal Arms; and
trumpeters stood aloft in the turrets, which were resounding
with horns and clarions in winding and expanding
melody. And in the front of the fortress
this appropriate and elegant writing was imprinted,
‘<em>The King’s City of Justice</em>.’ And there appeared,
on both sides, all the way along the Bridge, very
little youths; and, also, on both sides, out of the
stone-work before them, was a lofty column, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
height of the smaller towers, made of wood, not less
delicate than elegant, which was covered over with a
linen cloth painted the colour of white marble and
green jasper, as if it had been of a square shape, and
formed of stones cut out of the quarries. And upon
the summit of the column on the right side, was the
figure of an Antelope rampant, having a splendid
shield of the Royal Arms hanging about his neck,
and in his right foot he held a sceptre extended, and
offered it to the King. Upon the top of the other
column was the image of a lion, also rampant, which
carried a spear having the King’s banner displayed
upon the upper end, which he held aloft in his dexter
claw. And across, at the foot of the Bridge, was
erected the fabric of a Tower, the height of the
aforesaid columns, and painted; in the midst of
which, under a superb tabernacle, stood a most beautiful
effigy of St. George, all in armour, excepting his
head, which was adorned with laurel interwoven with
gems, which shone between it like precious stones for
their brightness. Behind him was a tapestry of
cotton, having his Arms resplendently embroidered
in a multitude of escutcheons. Upon his right was
suspended his triumphal helmet; upon his left his
shield of Arms of a correspondent magnitude; and
he had his right hand upon the handle of his sword,
which was girt about him. Upon the tower was
raised an extended scroll, containing these words,
‘<em>To God only be honour and glory</em>;’ and in front of
the building, this congratulatory prophecy,&mdash;Psalm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
xlvi. 4.&mdash;‘<em>The streams of the River make glad the
City of God</em>:’ and all the principal towers were gallantly
adorned with the Royal Arms embossed upon
them, or displayed in banners upon lances reared
above them. In the house adjoining to the fortress
behind, were innumerable children representing the
English Priesthood, in radiant garments with shining
countenances: others were like virgins, having their
hair adorned with laurels interwoven with gold; and
they continued singing from the coming in of the
King, with modulation of voice and melody of organs,
according to the words of this song in English.’</p>

<p>“I know very well that it is most common for the
events of the reign of Henry V., to be cited from the
‘<cite>History of his Life and Actions</cite>,’ written in Latin
verse by Thomas, a Monk of Elmham, in Norfolk,
in his time Prior of the Monastery of the Holy
Trinity at Lenton, in the County of Nottingham. As
that part of his Poem, however, which treats ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
adventu Regis ad Pontem Londoniarum</i>,’&mdash;concerning
the King’s entrance at the Bridge of London,&mdash;is considerably
inferior to the account which I have already
given you, I shall dispense with your labour in listening
to it, and mine in translating it; and only
observe to you, that an authentic copy of Thomas
of Elmham’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia de Vit&acirc; et Gest&acirc; Henrici V.
Anglorum Regis</cite>,’ is preserved in the Cottonian Manuscript
which I last cited, article 3, fairly written on
parchment, in the small black text-hand of the latter
part of the fifteenth century; and that the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
will be found at folio 101&#8201;b. Capitulum xliiii. I would
remind you, also, that a printed edition of this work
was published by Tom Hearne, Oxford, 1727, 8vo.,
which is not one of his most common books; the text
was taken from several old Manuscripts, and the
value of a large-paper copy fluctuates between four
and six guineas. The next authority, therefore, whom
I shall quote upon this subject, is supposed to have
been the production of the justly famous old John
Lydgate, who was in his days a very eminent English
Poet; being born about 1375, and dying about 1461.
He was a Monk of the Abbey of Bury, in Suffolk;
and of these historical verses by him there is a Manuscript
copy, written on parchment in an old Court-hand,
ornamented with vermillion chorusses and lines, in
No. 565, of the Harleian Manuscripts, in the British
Museum. You will find them forming Articles 8 and
9 of that volume, and thus entered in the Catalogue,
volume i. page 351. ‘<cite>A Poem upon the Wars of King
Henry the V. in France; and his return to England,
after the battle of Agincoure; composed perhaps by
John Lidgate</cite>.’&mdash;‘<em>The making of</em> (i. e. Poem upon) <em>the
comynge of the Kynge</em> (Henry V.) <em>out of Fraunce, to
London. By John Lidgate, the Monke of Bury.</em>’ Such
are the titles of these verses, from which I shall
repeat to you all that concerns the King’s entry at
London Bridge; and, firstly, at page 111&#8201;b. the story
runs thus, beginning at the second stanza of ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passus
Tercius</i>.’</p>

<p>“Thus finish Lydgate’s verses, so far as they relate
to these Pageants on London Bridge; but as they tell
us nothing of the Royal display upon that occasion, let
me remark to you, that we are told, in an Heraldical
Manuscript in the Harleian Collection, No. 6079, folio
24&#8201;a, that ‘At the cominge in of Kinge Henry the
V<sup>th</sup> out of Fraunce into Englande, his coursers were
trapped w<sup>th</sup> trappers of partye colours: scilicet, one
syde blewe velute embroudered w<sup>th</sup> Antellopes sittinge
vpon stayres w<sup>th</sup> longe flowers springinge betwixt
their horns.’ Which trappings were, by the
King’s order, subsequently given to the Abbey of
Westminster for the vestry, where they were converted
into copes and other Ecclesiastical habits.”</p>

<p>“But before you quite shut up your account of
these Pageants, my good Mr. Postern,” said I, as he
came to a close, “let <em>me</em> say a word or two, touching
those Royal supporters, which sat upon the columns
on London Bridge; since there are many curious
little points of Antiquity to be met with in the history
of Heraldic bearings. The first use of an Antelope
as a supporter to the King’s Arms, is doubtfully
hinted at in a Manuscript in the Harleian Library in
the British Museum, No. 2259, as having been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ancient as the reign of King Richard II.; though we
are much more certain that King Henry IV. entertained
a Pursuivant named Antelope, and probably
adopted such an animal as his dexter supporter, from
the family of Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex,
into which he married. The instance of a Lion also
appearing as a supporter, is mentioned in Gough’s
‘<cite>Sepulchral Monuments</cite>,’ which you have already
quoted, volume ii., part ii., page 68, from the information
of John Charles Brooke, Esq., Somerset
Herald, who says that when Henry V. became King,
he bore on the dexter side of his Arms, a Lion rampant
guardant, and on the sinister, an Antelope. We
read also that he bore an Antelope and a Swan, and
two Antelopes; and you may see all these excellently
drawn and described in Mr. Thomas Willement’s
‘<cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>,’ London, 1821, 4to., pages 21, 28,
30, 33, and 36.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks to you, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican,” recommenced
my visitor, “for this most opportune
display of your Heraldical learning: and, in returning
to London Bridge, I must observe, that as all history
is but a record of the evanescent scenes of human
life, it must, of course, be formed of all those strong
lights and shades which are so very conspicuous in its
original; and hence arises that striking contrast of
events, which so frequently fills us with solemnity
and awe. We retire, perchance, from a banquet to a
prison, or from a triumph to an execution; at least,
such is the nature of the next event which I find for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
our Chronicles, for the Towers of London Bridge
usually claimed a portion in most of the victims of
the axe and the scaffold. The principles of the Lollards,
as they were invidiously called, were then rapidly
spreading; and Sir John Oldcastle, commonly
called the good Lord Cobham, was one of the most
active leaders in the religious reform commenced by
Wickliffe: as he was not only at a very considerable
cost in collecting and transcribing his works, which
he caused to be widely distributed, but he also maintained
many of his disciples as itinerant preachers
throughout the country. Oldcastle had, however, escaped
from the power of the Clergy who had condemned
him as a heretic, and confined him in the
Tower; when King Henry being persuaded by them
that he headed 20,000 Lollards for his destruction, he
was attainted, and a large reward offered for his head:
in confirmation of which Stow informs us, in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’
page 352, that on the ‘viii day of October’&mdash;1416&mdash;‘was
a Parchment maker of Trill-melle Streete
drawne, hanged, and headed, for that he had harboured
Sir John Oldcastle:’ and the Harleian Chronicle,
No. 565, page 77&#8201;a, adds, that his head ‘was
set upon London Bridge for tretory.’ Another obscure
person, most probably concerned in the same
unhappy society, is also recorded as coming to a
similar end: for, ‘John Benet, Woolman,’ says Stow,
in the place I last cited, ‘who had in London scattered
sceduls full of sedition, was drawne, hanged,
and beheaded on Michaelmas-day:’ and the Harleian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Chronicle adds, that his head was also fixed upon
London Bridge.</p>

<p>“Our next ceremonial procession over this edifice
was the solemn and splendid funeral of King Henry V.;
when that gallant Sovereign had departed this life, on
Monday, the last day of August, 1422, at the Castle
of Bois de Vinciennes, a short distance from Paris.
That sumptuous spectacle is described in several
places, although I do not find it mentioned either in
the Life by Thomas of Elmham, or in that by Henry’s
Chaplain; but Stow, in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 363, says
that the Royal body arrived in London about the
tenth of November, and so was conveyed by London
Bridge through Cheapside, to the Cathedral Church of
St. Paul, where funereal exequies were performed; and
thence it was carried and interred in Westminster
Abbey. As the corse advanced in rich and solemn
procession over the Bridge, it was truly a magnificent
and imposing spectacle. On a royal chariot, decorated
with cloth of gold like a bed of state, was laid a
figure exactly representing the late King, habited in a
robe of purple velvet, lined with ermine; wearing an
imperial diadem of gold and jewels on the head, and
bearing in the hands, the regal sceptre, and the
mound and cross. The face, which was painted exactly
to resemble the life, was uncovered, and looking
towards Heaven; and on the bed lay a covering of red
silk beaten with gold. The chariot was drawn by six
stout horses, richly harnessed, with heraldic devices
upon their housings: thus, the first bore the Arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of St. George; the second, of Normandy; the third,
those of King Arthur; the fourth, those of St. Edward
the Confessor; the fifth, the coat of France,
alone; and the sixth, those of France and England
quarterly. When the chariot passed through any
town of eminence, a rich and costly canopy was held
over it, by some of its more honourable attendants;
and it was surrounded by three hundred torch-bearers
habited in white; by five thousand men-at-arms on
horseback in black armour, holding their spears reversed;
and by a multitude of Lords bearing pennons,
banners, and bannerolls; whilst twelve captains went
before carrying the King’s achievement. After the
body followed the servants of the Household all in
black; then came James I., King of Scotland, as
Chief Mourner, with the Princes and Lords of the
Royal blood, in mourning habits; and lastly, at the
distance of two miles in the rear, followed Queen
Katharine, no less honourably attended.</p>

<p>“We learn, also, from a very interesting history of
King Henry V. in English, contained in the Harleian
Manuscripts, No. 35, folio 138&#8201;a, that when the
funeral ‘should enter the Cittye, ten Bishopps, w<sup>th</sup>
their pontificall adornments revested, and many
Abbotts mytored, and other men of the Church in
greate number, with a right great multitude of Cittizens
of the same Cittie, went out thereof to meet the
Corps, and receaued it with due honnour. And all
y<sup>e</sup> saide Spiritualls singinge, the officers accustomed
in like case, conveyed the same Corps by London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Bridge, and by Lumbart Streete, thoroughe the
Cheape vnto y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall Churche of Saint Paule.’
This life of King Henry is partly a translation from
the Latin of Titus Livius, an Historian of his reign,
who called himself by that name, and the French
Chronicles of Enguerrant. The other particulars you
will find set down in Stow, as I have already cited
him, and in two Manuscript volumes of Heraldic
ceremonies, in the Harleian Library, No. 2076, folio
6&#8201;b, and No. 6079, folio 23&#8201;b; and in finishing our
imperfect notices of this reign, let me close with almost
the very words of the good old London Historian
to whom we are so much indebted&mdash;‘Thus this most
victorious and renowned King entred the way decreed
for every creature, in the flower and most lusty time
of his age, to wit, when he was six and twenty years
old, when he had reigned nine years, and five months
with glory.’</p>

<p>“You must, doubtless, worthy Mr. Barbican, well
remember the discord which Shakspeare represents
to have existed between the Protector, Humphrey
Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester; and Cardinal Beaufort,
Bishop of Winchester: and the fray which takes
place between their serving-men in blue coats and
tawny coats, on Tower-hill. This is in his ‘<cite>First
Part of Henry the Sixth</cite>,’ Act I, Scene 3; but we
learn from Fabyan’s ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ page 413, that they
once disturbed London Bridge with a brawl that
wore a much darker aspect. It was customary in
the more ancient days of this City, that the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Mayor should be elected on the Feast of St.
Simon and St. Jude, on the 28th of October; and
that on the day following he should be sworn in at
Westminster. It was then, during the subsequent
banquet of Sir John Coventry, Citizen and Mercer,
that the Protector sent for him in great haste, and
commanded him to watch the City securely during
the night following; and on Tuesday, the 30th of October,&mdash;for,
in 1425, St. Simon and St. Jude’s day
happened on a Sunday, and therefore the Lord Mayor
was elected the day after,&mdash;about nine in the morning,
some of the Bishop’s servants came from his Palace
on the Bankside, to enter at the Bridge Gate, when
the warders, as they were commanded, kept them out
by force. Upon which repulse, they retired in great
discontent, and, gathering together a larger body of
Archers and men-at-arms than that which kept the
gate, assaulted it as a hostile City. All London was
immediately alarmed; the Citizens shut their shops
and hastened down to the Bridge in great multitudes;
and a conflict would speedily have commenced, had
it not been for the prudence and mediation of the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen, Henry Chicheley, Archbishop
of Canterbury, and the Prince of Portugal;
who rode between the Protector and the Bishop, eight
several times, ere they could bring them to any
agreement; until, at length, they both consented to
refer their dispute to the decision of John Plantagenet,
Duke of Bedford, and Regent of France. The
quarrel was, however, not concluded until the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Easter, which began on the last day of March.
In defending London Bridge, the Protector appeared
to be only retaliating upon the Bishop; for, in the
third article of his charges against him, he stated, that
once, when he was quietly riding to attend the King,
the Bishop attempted his death at the Bridge foot,
by assembling archers and soldiers in Southwark;
by setting up engines to stop his way; by drawing
the chain, used in ancient fortifications, across the
Bridge; and by placing men in windows and turrets
to cast down stones upon the heads of him and his
followers.</p>

<p>“I have already mentioned to you, that there were
several Towers erected on London Bridge, both for
defence and ornament; although we have not any authentic
historical notice concerning them, until we
arrive at the year 1426, when Stow tells us in his
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., pages 61, 65, that the Tower at the
North end of the Drawbridge, over which the heads
of Traitors were wont to be set, was then began to be
newly built, in the Mayoralty of Sir John Raynewell,
Citizen and Fishmonger; who bore for his Arms,
Parted per pale indented Argent and Sable, a Chevron
Gules. He laid one of the first stones of the edifice,
and the Bridge-Master, with John Arnold and John
Higham, the Sheriffs, laid the others. Upon each of
these four stones, the name IHESUS was engraven
in fair Roman characters, and at the rebuilding of
this Gate and Tower in April 1577, they were laid up
as Memorials in the Bridge House. The Drawbridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
over which it was erected, was, at this period, readily
raised up or lowered, that ships might pass up the
River to Queenhithe; which was, during the use of
this convenience, a principal strand for their lading
and unlading, as being in the centre and heart of
the City.</p>

<p>“In the year 1428, we find a short, but certain
proof, that the passing beneath London Bridge was
not less dangerous, than it is at present. You will
see the circumstance mentioned in Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>.’
page 369, but I prefer giving it you in the words of
the often-mentioned Harleian Manuscript, No. 565,
folio 87&#8201;b, which was, very probably, the original
authority of the good old Chronicler. ‘Also this
same yere,’&mdash;says the record,&mdash;‘the viij day of Nouember,
the Duke of Norfolk, with many a gentil
man, squyer, and yoman, tok his barge at Seynt
Marye Ouerye be twen iiij and v of y<sup>e</sup> belle a yens
nyzt, and proposyd to passe thorugh London Bregge.
Where of the forseid barge, thorugh mysgouernance
of stearyng, fell vp on the pyles and ouerwhelmyd.
The whyche was cause of spyllyng many
a gentil man and othere; the more ruthe was! But
as God wolde, y<sup>e</sup> Duke him self and too or iij othere
gentyl men, seying that myschief, leped vp on y<sup>e</sup>
pyles, and so were saved thorugh helpe of them that
weren a bove y<sup>e</sup> Brigge with castyng downe of ropes.’
The Duke of Norfolk, to whom this misfortune happened,
was John Mowbray, the second of that title,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
who had served under King Henry V. in France,
and who died October the 19th, 1432.</p>

<p>“We next come down to the April of 1431, when
an association was formed at Abingdon, in Berkshire,
headed by one William Mandeville, a weaver, and
Bailiff of the Town, who entitled himself Jack Sharp,
of Wigmore’s land, in Wales. The Protector took
instant order for his apprehension, and when examined,
he confessed that it was intended ‘to have made
Priests’ heads as plenty as Sheeps’ heads, ten for a
penny.’ His own, however, did not remain on his
shoulders long after, for he was executed as a traitor,
at Abingdon, and his head erected on London Bridge,
whilst his companions were also hanged and quartered
in other places. You find this fact related by
Fabyan in his ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ page 422.</p>

<p>“From these scanty notices of misery, infatuation,
and crime, it is with much delight that we turn to
a spectacle of the greatest magnificence, and the most
distinguished character, which London Bridge ever
witnessed: the entrance of King Henry VI. to the
City, after his Coronation as King of France, in the
Church of N&ocirc;tre Dame, at Paris, on Friday, the 7th
of December, 1431. On the 9th of the February following,
he landed at Dover, and upon Thursday, the
21st of the same month, he was met by the Mayor
and Corporation of London at Blackheath. Of their
ceremony in conducting him towards the City, and the
numerous Pageants which they had prepared to meet
him at London Bridge, I shall now proceed to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
you an account, extracted from Alderman Fabyan’s
‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ volume ii., pages 423-425, and from
Lydgate’s Poem on the ‘<cite>Comynge of y<sup>e</sup> Kynge out of
Fraunce to London</cite>;’ of which a very fair copy is preserved
in that Harleian Manuscript which I have already
quoted, No. 565, folio 114&#8201;b. The verses by
Lydgate are not very common in any form, and they
have, as I think, been but once printed in connection
with the history of London Bridge, which is in
Malcolm’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Londinum Redivivum</cite>,’ already cited, volume
ii., page 397; and, although you may conceive that
I quote too much of them, I cannot deny myself the
pleasure of beginning at the very commencement,
since it is but little less beautiful than Chaucer’s immortal
Tales. Listen, then, Mr. Barbican, I pray you
listen; if you have ears for either Poesy or Romance.</p>

I very much suspect that the Corporation of our good

<p>“The King next passed on to the Conduit in Cornhill,
where he was awaited by other Pageants equally
sumptuous and interesting; but as these are out of
our province, we shall mention them no farther.</p>

<p>“There seems to have gone abroad a singular conception,
that the Chapel of St. Thomas on London
Bridge did not exist beyond the time of King Henry
the Sixth; in the 23rd year of whose reign,&mdash;1458,&mdash;there
were four Chaplains serving in it; though it
was originally founded but for two Priests, four
Clerks, and their officers, independently of the several
chantries, or revenues, left to the establishment,
for the singing of daily mass for the souls of its
benefactors. The income of the Chapel, however,
more than ten years before that period, was considered
as worthy of some inquiry on the part of a
neighbouring ecclesiastic; for we find, in Newcourt’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Repertorium</cite>,’ which I have already cited, volume i.,
page 396, the following particulars concerning it.
‘In the year 1433,’ says this Author, ‘Sir John
Brockle, then Mayor of London, upon a controversie
that was then like to arise, between the said Mayor
and Commonalty of London, and the Bridge-Masters
on the one part, and Richard Morysby, Archdeacon
of London, and Rector of St. Magnus Church, on
the other, about the oblations and other spiritual
profits, which were made in a certain Chapel, called
the Chapel of St. Thomas on the Bridge, within the
precincts of this parish; there was a composition, or
agreement, then made, and confirmed by Robert
Fitzhugh, then Bishop of London, whereby (inter
alia) it was agreed, that the Chaplains of the Chapel,
and their successors, should receive all the profits of
the Chapel to the use of the same, and the Bridge,
and should pay yearly at Michaelmas the sum of xx<em>d.</em>
to the said Church of St. Magnus, and to the Rector
of the same, and to his successors for ever.’</p>

<p>“And now that we are speaking of the property
appertaining to London Bridge, it will be a fit place
to give you some idea whence it was in general derived;
I say, in general, because the inquiry into all
its sources would be not only difficult, but almost
impossible. Stow tells you in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 59, that after the erection of buildings upon
London Bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> ‘many charitable men gave lands,
tenements, or sums of money, towards the maintenance
thereof: all which was sometimes noted, and
in a table fair written for posterity remaining in the
Chapel, till the same Chapel was turned to a dwelling-house,
and then removed to the Bridge-House.’ The
honest old Antiquary states, however, that he would
willingly have given a copy of this table of benefactors,
but that he could not procure a sight of it;
for, as he was known to be a notable restorer of decayed
and dormant charities, he was occasionally refused
admission to such records as would have enabled
him to compile a lasting register of all the
pious gifts and benefactions in London. He never
hesitated to reprove unfaithful Executors, whether
Corporations, or private persons, some of which he
caused to perform the testaments which they proved;
whilst the dishonesty of others he left on record to futurity.
It is then not to be wondered at, if he often-times
met with a repulse instead of information; ignorance
opposed him in one quarter, and interest in
another; and he might very well have taken up the
significant, though homely complaint of Ames, when
he was composing his History of Printing, ‘Some
of those persons <em>treats</em> folks, as if they came as spies
into their affairs.’ We have, however, some particulars
of the Bridge property, as well collected by
Stow, as gathered since his time; and, firstly, I must
notice to you, that at page 60 of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ he
states that ‘John Feckenham, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civis et Bracciator</cite>,’&mdash;Citizen
and Brewer, or perhaps, Corn-Meter, ‘by his
will, dated May 11th, 1436, bequeathed to the Mayor
and Commonalty of the City of London, a Tenement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
with a Shop and Garden, in the Parish of St. Augustine
Pappey,’&mdash;that is to say in St. Mary at Axe,&mdash;‘between
the tenement and lands of the Bridge of the
City of London on the East, &amp;c. To have to the Mayor
and Commonalty of London, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad usum et sustentationem
operis Pontis pr&aelig;dictis in perpetuum</i>,’&mdash;for the use and
support of the work of the aforesaid Bridge for ever,&mdash;‘on
condition that the Chaplains of the Chapel of
St. Thomas the Martyr, on the Bridge, celebrating,
have his soul, and also the souls of the late Lord
Richard II., King of England, Edward Boteler,
knight, and the Lady Anne his wife, Richard Storme,
and Alice his wife, and the soul of Joan, his’&mdash;the
said Feckenham’s&mdash;‘wife, perpetually recommended in
their prayers.’ You may see both the original and
an authentic copy of this Will, and that which I shall
hereafter mention, in the Bishop of London’s Registry
in St. Paul’s Cathedral. The Chamber in which
they are kept, is entered through the Vestry on the
Northern side of the nave; whence a flight of dark
winding stairs, lighted only by loop-holes, leads you
to a small square room, surrounded by oaken presses
containing the original Wills tied up in bundles. The
Calendar, or Index to the Register Books, extends
from 1418 to 1599; all after that year being kept at
the Bishop’s Consistory Court in Great Knight-Ryder
Street. It is a small folio volume, having a parchment
cover, anciently tied with strings, and is written in a
small neat black text upon parchment, though now
much soiled by time and the continual dust of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
chamber. If ever you visit this Registry, however, I
would not have you trust too much to this Calendar;
for in referring to the Will which I have now quoted,
its volume and page are called ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moore, prima pars,
folio</cite> iiij.;’ though the true reference is ‘<cite>3 Moore, folio</cite>
cccclxij a.’ This volume, <cite>Moore</cite>, is so called from the
first Will entered in it, and it contains registers of
Wills from the year 1418 to 1438, beautifully written
in a small black text upon parchment, in a very thick
square folio.</p>

<p>“Another benefactor to London Bridge mentioned
by Stow, was one John Edwards, Citizen and Butcher,
who ‘gave by his Will, dated the 8th of November,
1442, to John Hatherle, Mayor of the City of London,
and to John Herst and Thomas Cook, Masters of the
work of the Bridge of London, for ever, his tenement,
with a garden, in the Parish of St. Botolph,
Aldgate, situate between the tenement lately John
Cornwallys’s on the South, &amp;c., and extending from
the King’s Street leading from Aldgate towards the
Tower on the West, &amp;c. towards the sustaining and
reparation of the said Bridge.’ You will find this
Will in the Register called 4 <em>Stacy</em>, now <em>Prowet</em>,
folio ciiij b, which extends from 1438 to 1449; though
the Calendar marks it as entered at folio xxv. Both
of these Wills are in Latin.</p>

<p>“Without, at present, referring to the multitudes of
books and records of Bridge property, which must
exist in the office of the Comptroller of its Estates,
I will give you an abstract of one of these volumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of which a Manuscript copy is to be found in the
Harleian Collection in the British Museum, No. 6016,
folio 152. This book is entitled ‘<cite>A Repertory by
way of Survey, of all the forren landes belonging to
London Bridge, to geather with all the quitt rents due to,
and other rents due from the same</cite>:’ and the industrious
mortal who copied it out has added, ‘Borrowed the
booke 21&deg;. ffebr. 1653 of Captaine Richard Lee, Clarke
of the Bridge-house.’ The Survey is written in corrupt
and abbreviated Latin, which, from the expressions
which are made use of, would appear like the language
of the fifteenth century; and it contains many
curious particulars of the names of persons and
places, not elsewhere to be found. I purpose, however,
giving you only a general statement of the
amount of Bridge property in different places, with a
few notices and extracts from the more interesting
parts; reminding you, that these abstracts have never
yet been printed.&mdash;In the Parish of St. Andrew the
Bishop, London Bridge possessed 20 huts or cabins,
occupied by the Brotherhood of Friars Minors, which
were valued at &pound;12. 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> Then follows an entry
of ‘Lands and Meadows belonging to the Bridge of
London without the bar of Southwark, at Le Loke,
in Hattesham, Camerwelle, Lewesham, and Stratford.’
In Lambeth field without Southwark, or St. George’s
bar, 19 acres of land, lying towards Newington and
Lambeth, held of the Prior of Bermondsey, for the
yearly rent of 14<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em> At Le Loke,&mdash;that is to
say, partly on the site of the New Kent Road, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
on part of which was, doubtless, built that row of
houses in Blackman Street, now called Bridge-house-Place,&mdash;4
acres of arable land, called Longland, and
2&frac12; acres and 1 rood of meadow land, held by the
yearly rent of 5<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em>, payable at the Feast of St.
Michael. Also, on the South part of King Street,
2 acres of arable, and 2 acres of meadow land, called
Carpenterishawe, held of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
at the yearly rent of 6<em>d.</em>, payable at the Feast
of St. Michael the Archangel. Also near St. Thomas
Wateringgs, on the South part of King’s Street, 7
acres of arable, and 2 acres of meadow land, called
Fourecrofts, by the yearly rent of 4<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>, payable at
the Feast of St. Michael, and at Easter; another
piece of land lying towards Hattesham,&mdash;perhaps
Hatcham Manor,&mdash;containing 10 acres of arable, and
2&frac12; acres and 1 rood of meadow land, called Tevatree,
was held for the same sum. At Le Steerte, near the
wall of Bermondsey, one acre of meadow ground, for
the rent of 2<em>d.</em> per annum; and at Hattesham, at the
entrance of the Marsh, 6 acres of arable land enclosed
by a ditch, were held of the heirs of Simon de Kyme,
for the rent of one penny per annum. In Lewisham,
London Bridge seems to have had large possessions,
since they were let out to farm at the immense rent
of &pound;3. 4<em>s.</em>; and to the property of the Manor was
attached the ancient feudal rights of heriot,&mdash;taking
of the best beast, when a new tenant came on the
estate; wardship,&mdash;the holding and enjoying the profits
of a tenant’s land, who was a minor; marriage,&mdash;claiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
assistance from all the tenants once, to
furnish a dowry for the Lord’s eldest daughter; Reliefs
and Escheats,&mdash;the payment of a certain sum on
the entry of a new tenant, and the return of forfeited
estates. The land itself was divided, and the
original rents were as follow.</p>

<p>“‘24 and 11 acres of arable land, called the Greggehouse,
5 acres of wood, in two groves, 42 acres
of arable land, and 2 acres of meadow land, held
of the Abbot of Gaunt, at the yearly rent of
14<em>s.</em> 9&frac12;<em>d.</em>; 22 acres held of the heirs of Lord John de
Backwell, Knight, at the yearly rent of 3<em>s.</em>; 10 acres,
and 10 acres in the field called Edwinesfelde, held of
the Abbot of Stratford, at the yearly rent of 10<em>d.</em>;
2 acres held of the heirs of Lord William Bonquer,
Knight, at the yearly rent of 8<em>d.</em>; 1&frac12; acre lying in
the road near Depeford Bregge, held of the heirs of
William Clekots, at the yearly rent of 1&frac12;<em>d.</em>; 3 acres
in a croft near Leuesham Street, held of the heirs of
Henry Boyding, and William Atteford, at the yearly
rent of 2<em>d.</em>; 1&frac12; acre at Rombeigh, for which nothing
is paid; 10 acres in the field called Brodefelde, held
of the heirs of William de Hinntingfeld, Knight,
at the yearly rent of 1<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> <em>Item.</em> There is owing for
the said Manor to the heirs of Nicholas de Farndon,
the yearly rent of 1<em>d.</em> At Leuesham, a water-mill,
with 2 acres of pasture belonging to it, held of divers
persons for the rent of 1<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em> and half a quarter of
corn out of the tolls yearly, and the value of the
tenths, from this time forth for ever.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>“The possessions of London Bridge, at Stratford,
have been already referred to, but for the sake of perspicuity,
I repeat them, and they were as follow:&mdash;One
water-mill, called ‘Saynesmelle,’ and four acres
of meadow land belonging to the same; ‘whereof one
acre lies within the close of the said mill, and four
roods opposite to it on the East; and they are every
where planted round with willows.’ One acre and
one rood of meadow land lie near ‘Wyldemersh-bregge,’
and are called ‘Horslese.’ They are held of
the heirs of the Lord Richard de Playz, Knight, for
the yearly rent of &pound;1. 17<em>s.</em>&mdash;Also at Stratford are ten
acres of meadow-land held of the same, and for the
same rent: whereof four acres are adjoining to the
mill-pond called ‘Spileman’s Melle,’ and four acres
are lying near to the meadow called ‘Gryggewyche’s
Mead,’ and adjoin, in like manner, to the same mill-stream.
And one acre lies near the Bridge called
‘Wildenmersshbregge,’ and is enclosed by willows;
and three roods of the same meadow lie near ‘Golynant,’
and one acre and one rood of the same meadow
are lying in one piece, adjoining to the mill-stream of
‘Saynesmelle.’ At Royeshope, is one acre of meadow
land, formerly held by John Breggewrythe, at the
yearly rent of 2<em>s.</em> which is held, &amp;c. as aforesaid. Also
there are of the same, 1&frac12; rood near Horslese, originally
bought by Roger Atte-vyne, and John Sterre,
then Keepers of the Bridge, which are held of the
heirs of Thomas le Belevere, for the annual rent of
1<em>d.</em> The Vicar of West-Ham also held one acre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
meadow, assigned to him for his tythe for the whole
meadow; and 13<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> were paid to him yearly, as
tythe for the two mills. At Stratford, also, was another
water-mill belonging to London Bridge, called
‘Spylemanne’s Melle,’ which was held of the heirs
of Lawrance Stede, for the payment of 1<em>d.</em> yearly;
which mill being of Sutler’s estate, tythes were paid
for it by that estate, and it was therefore free for ever.
There were also four acres of meadow and pasture
belonging to it. All the foregoing were, at the time
of this survey, let out to farm by London Bridge.</p>

<p>“Such were some of its possessions out of the metropolis;
and I now proceed to notice that more interesting
part of the volume, entitled ‘<cite>Quit-rents of
London Bridge, issuing from divers tenements of London
and Southwark, according as they lie in different Parishes;
and, firstly, of its property in the Parish of
St. Magnus the Martyr</cite>.’</p>

<p>“‘Three shops, with galleries built upon them, now

Glovers, standing at the Bridge stairs towards London,
with the houses belonging to London Bridge on

the Fraternity called ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Salue</i>,’ in the Church aforesaid.
Two shops with galleries built thereupon, held

and they owe yearly to the Bridge of London, 3<em>s.</em>’
Another Tenement, held by Henry Ziuele, Mason,
paid 5<em>s.</em>: and it was situate between the King’s Road
on the East, and the Oyster Gate on the West.
Another Tenement paid 5 marks,&mdash;&pound;3. 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>;&mdash;it
stood ‘at the corner opposite to St. Magnus’ Church,’
between the King’s Road towards ‘Byllyngesgate’ on
the South, and the King’s Road, called ‘Brigge-streete,’
on the West. It belonged to a certain perpetual
Chantry in St. Magnus’ Church, for the soul of
Thomas le Bener; also belonging to the same Chantry,
and standing about the same spot, was a tavern,
which paid to the Bridge 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> yearly, and the shop
of the same paid 1<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> Certain other shops and
tenements belonging to Richard, the son of John
Horne,&mdash;perhaps the eminent Town-Clerk of that
name, whom I have already mentioned,&mdash;paid &pound;2. of
yearly rent; and they were lying near the narrow
way called Rederes lane on the East, in the Parishes
of St. Magnus and St. Roth’i. A house belonging to
the Priory and Convent of St. Mary, in Southwark,

and the houses belonging to St. Magnus’ Church on

‘Stokfissmongeres Rewe,’ on the North, down to the
River Thames on the South. Another house in the
Bridge Street, standing by that of John Somervyle,

also an adjoining shop and house; thus making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
whole Bridge Rents in St. Magnus’ Parish amount to
&pound;7. 8<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em> per annum. I have been the more particular
in detailing the property of London Bridge in
this part of City, because it in some measure illustrates
the ancient state of it; but I shall be much
more brief,&mdash;and, I dare say, much more to your

<p>“Such, Mr. Barbican, were the gifts to London
Bridge of Quit-rents, or small sums reserved by
various landlords out of their charters and leases, for
the support and improvement of this noble edifice.
Their whole amount was &pound;30. 0<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> <em>per annum</em>, a
splendid revenue, if, as I imagine from several circumstances,
this very curious survey was made about the
middle of the thirteenth century. Several of these
gifts are authenticated by references to the original
grants, read and enrolled in the Court of Hustings at
Guildhall, at various meetings held during the reign
of King Edward I.: whilst another authority, often
cited, is called ‘the Red Rental,’ which also makes
mention of Godardus, a Chaplain, and his brethren of
London Bridge. The light these very brief but curious
notices shed upon Parochial history and antiquities,
has made me give you a more particular
account of them, than might be perfectly agreeable to
you; though, as I have not quite finished the volume,
I must request you patiently to hear me a little longer
speak of the ancient landed property of London
Bridge.”</p>

<p>“Oh! go on, Sir, pray go on!” said I, in a tone of
mock resignation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> “take your own time, Mr. Barnaby;
though, to be sure, there seems but little reason
why I should say so. I had, indeed, fondly hoped,
that when you could no longer plague me with a
Patent Roll, I might rest secure from any thing more
provoking; but I must certainly own I was a most
short-sighted mortal for thinking so, since your genius
can never want a weapon to be drowsy with: but, I
suppose that you rarely meet with a hearer so quiet,
so mild, so undoubting, and so easily satisfied as I
have proved: and therefore, suffer I must.”</p>

<p>“I have truly,” said he, in a short dry voice,
“seldom met with a companion like you: but, I am
sure, you will not think these extracts wearisome,
when you remember that so little is known about the
possessions of London Bridge; and that the fragments
which I have repeated to you are all of the most undoubted
authority, as yet unprinted, and almost
locked up in a barbarous mixture of abbreviated and
corrupt French, Saxon, and Latin. To return then to
the Survey,&mdash;which, I assure you, I have very nearly
concluded,&mdash;it next records the Bridge property at
‘Les Stocks,’ somewhat of which, you may remember,
I have already spoken: and contains one of the most
curious and ancient descriptions of that once-famous
market now extant:&mdash;thus commences the entry.</p>

<p>“‘Near the Church of the Blessed Mary of Wolcherchehawe,
is a certaine Cattle-Fold called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les
Stocks</i>, ordained for Butchers and Fishmongers, where
the same may sell flesh and fish; the rent of which
is uncertain, because any greater or smaller value
arises from the way in which places in it may be
occupied by the Butchers upon Flesh-days, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the Fishmongers on Fish-days. Upon this Cattle-stall
are three mansions, and one slaughter-house,
built above it, the principal of which mansions is
towards Cornhill, being now held by William Vale,
Fishmonger, and it yields to London Bridge, yearly,
30<em>s.</em> Also, on the West side, towards the Conduit,
is another mansion, held by John Louekyn, Fishmonger,
which pays yearly 20<em>s.</em> Also there is another
little mansion in the middle of the house upon the
Stocks on the North side, paying 10<em>s.</em> Also on the
South part of the Stocks is a slaughter-house, for
which rent is not paid. Total 60<em>s.</em> And in the stalls
aforesaid, called the Stocks, are places measured for
the Fishmongers’ tables, namely four feet and a half
and two thumbs breadth in length, and called <em>Poulisset</em>,
having legs, the which places are occupied by
the Butchers on Flesh-days at the price of 4<em>d.</em> the
week. And the same places are occupied by the
Fishmongers on Fish-days, at the price of 3<em>d.</em> by the
week. Of these places there are 19 on the South
part next the Church; 18 on the North; 15, in one
row, in the middle of the house on the South; and at
the Eastern front of the said house are four places for
Fishmongers, three of which are occupied by Butchers
on the Flesh-days. In the West front of the said
house are two places, occupied as well by Butchers
as by Fishmongers; but the certain amount of the
rents of these cannot be ascertained, because any of
the aforesaid places may be occupied or not, and thus
a larger or a smaller sum may appear upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
account-rolls of the gate-keepers of the place aforesaid,
in different weeks and years. Without the
Stocks, at the West front, are five places for Fishmongers,
where, on Fish-days, they sell their fish;
and, on Flesh-days, three of them are occupied by the
Butchers. There are also 22 places and a half under
the walls of the house, appointed for Butchers to sell
flesh on Flesh-days; whereof 18 places are under the
North wall, and 4 places and a half are under the
wall of the Eastern front, of which places the value,
when they are occupied, is 4<em>d.</em> per week: but now
they are not fully engaged, and therefore no certain
sum can be stated.’</p>

<p>“‘Also, it is to be known that the gifts, legacies,
and oblations of the Corbell-Chapel, standing on the
Bridge, with’&mdash;the Pontage from&mdash;‘the carts carrying
bread for sale crossing over it, and the passage of
vessels under it, are uncertain in amount, because
they may be greater or less in value, as they appear
in the account-rolls of the Keepers of the said Bridge
for different years.’</p>

<p>“The Survey concludes with an abstracted list of
rents paid by London Bridge for lands and tenements
held in various places, both in, and out of, the City;
but as I have already given you several particulars of
these, and as they do not contain any great additional
information, I shall but observe from them that their
total amount appears to be &pound;20.&#8201;0.&#8201;9&frac14;<em>d.</em>; and as we are
occasionally informed that the lands were let out to
farm, we may conclude that the Bridge-keepers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
amply recompensed for the payment of a sum even
so great as this. The disbursements of London
Bridge were, indeed, always considerable, for Stow observes
in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ page 59, that the account of
William Mariner and Christopher Elliott, Wardens of
that edifice, from Michaelmas, in the 22nd year of
Henry VII.&mdash;1506,&mdash;to the Michaelmas ensuing, amounted
to &pound;815. 17<em>s.</em> 2&frac12;<em>d.</em>, all payments and allowances
included.</p>

<p>“We must now set sail again on the ocean of
English History, as it is connected with London
Bridge; and you are to remember that we are yet in
the reign of King Henry VI., though we have mentioned
a multitude of dates since the commencement
of our digression: and the next event in its Chronicles,
relates to the destruction of a considerable
portion of it in the year 1437. I have already
cited to you some of the writings of William of Worcester,
and in another work of which he was also the
author, entitled ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annales Rerum Anglicarum</cite>,’ he gives
a slight notice of this event, which you will find in
the edition printed in Hearne’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger</cite>,’ volume
ii. page 458, taken from an autograph manuscript
in the Library of the College of Arms. The
best accounts, however, are furnished by Fabyan, on
page 433, of his Chronicle, and by Stow in his
‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 376. From these we learn that on
Monday, January the 14th, the Great Stone Gate, and
Tower standing upon it, next Southwark, fell suddenly
down into the River, with two of the fairest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
arches of the same Bridge: ‘and yet,’ adds the habitually
pious Stow, ‘no man perished in body, which
was a great worke of God.’</p>

<p>“In the year 1440, the Annals of London Bridge
became again interwoven with the great historical
events of the kingdom, which impart such dignity
to its own records, inasmuch as the Bridge-Street,
by which is meant as well the passage over the
Thames as the main street beyond it on each side,
was one scene of the public penance of Eleanor
Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester, for Witchcraft. The
inflexible honesty of the Duke, who was Protector of
England during the minority of Henry VI., and presumptive
heir to the crown, had created a violent party
against him, the heads of which were Cardinal Henry
Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and William de la Pole,
first Duke of Suffolk. With regard to his Sovereign,
however, not all the spies, which were placed about
Humphrey Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester, by these
powerful and inveterate enemies, could find even a
pretence for the slightest charge; though that which
they were unable to discover in him, they found
in his Duchess, who was then accused of Witchcraft
and High Treason: it being asserted that she had
frequent conferences with one Sir Roger Bolinbroke,
a Priest, who was supposed to be a necromancer,
and Margaret Jourdain, a witch, of Eye, near Westminster;
assisted and advised by John Hum, a Priest,
and Thomas Southwell, Priest, and Canon of St.
Stephen’s, Westminster. Shakspeare, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> ‘<cite>Second
Part of Henry the Sixth</cite>,’ Act i. Scenes 2 and 4, and
Act ii. Scenes 1 and 4, has recorded several particulars
of this circumstance; and makes the Duchess
ask some questions concerning the King’s fate; though
she was, in reality, charged with having his image
made of wax, which, being placed before a slow fire,
should cause his strength to decay as the wax melted.
The result of the enquiry was, that Jourdain was
burned in Smithfield; Southwell died before his execution,
in the Tower; Bolingbroke was hanged,
drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; and, on November
the 9th, the Duchess was sentenced to perform public
penance at three open places in London. On Monday
the 13th, therefore, she came by water from Westminster,
and, landing at the Temple-bridge, walked,
at noon-day, through Fleet-street, bearing a waxen
taper of two pounds weight to St. Paul’s, where she
offered it at the High Altar. On the Wednesday following
she landed at the Old Swan, and passed
through Bridge-street and Grace-Church-street to
Leadenhall, and at Cree-Church, near Aldgate, made
her second offering: and on the ensuing Friday, she
was put on shore at Queen-Hythe, whence she proceeded
to St. Michael’s Church, Cornhill, and so completed
her penance. In each of these processions her
head was covered only by a kerchief, her feet were
bare; scrolls, containing a narrative of her crime, were
affixed to her white dress, and she was received and
attended by the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Companies of
London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“The leading features of these events are of course
in all the numerous volumes of English History, but
for the more particular circumstances I must refer
you to Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ pages 381, 382; to folio lxiiii. a,
of the Chronicle of Edward Hall, an eminent Lawyer
who died in 1547, and whose work is entitled ‘<cite>The
Vnion of the two Noble Houses of Lancastre and Yorke</cite>,’
London, 1550, folio; and, finally, to the Harleian
Manuscript No. 565, page 96&#8201;a. Of which latter
most curious work we now take leave, for soon after
recording this event it terminates imperfectly; though
I may observe, that when speaking of the fate of
Roger Bolingbroke, on page 96&#8201;b, it adds, concerning
him, that the same day on which he was condemned
at Guildhall, he ‘was drawe fro y<sup>e</sup> Tower of London
to Tiborn and there hanged, hedyd, and quartered,
and his heed set up on London Bridge.’ His quarters
were disposed of at Hereford, Oxford, York, and
Cambridge.</p>

<p>“In 1444, William de la Pole, whom I have just
mentioned, was one of the King’s Ambassadors in
France, when, with his usual lofty and impetuous
spirit, he suddenly proposed a marriage between
Henry VI., and Margaret, daughter of R&eacute;n&eacute;, Duke
of Anjou, and titular King of Jerusalem, Sicily, Arragon,
Valence, &amp;c. without any instructions from his
Sovereign, or even acquainting his fellow-commissioners
with his design. Notwithstanding the Duke
of Gloucester opposed this union at the Council Board
in England, yet the Earl managed his proposal so skilfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that he procured himself to be created a Duke,
and despatched into France to bring over the Queen:
and on Thursday, the 22nd of April, 1445, she was
consequently married to Henry at Tichfield Abbey,
Southwick, in the County of Southampton. It was,
probably, in her way from Eltham Palace to Westminster,
before her Coronation, that she was greeted
by the famous pageants prepared for her on London
Bridge, on Friday, the 28th of May; for you will remember
that she was crowned at Westminster Abbey,
on Sunday, the 30th of the month, by John Stafford,
Archbishop of Canterbury. However it might be,
she was met at several places by many persons of
rank, with numerous attendants having their sleeves
embroidered, or decorated in the most costly manner,
with badges of beaten goldsmith’s work; and especially
by the Duke of Gloucester, who received her
with 500 men habited in one livery. At Blackheath,
according to custom, the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen,
clothed in scarlet, attended her with the several
City companies, all mounted and dressed in blue
gowns, having embroidered sleeves and red hoods:
and in this manner Queen Margaret and her followers
were conducted through Southwark and the City,
‘then beautified,’&mdash;says Stow in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page
384, where he relates all these particulars,&mdash;‘with pageants
of diuers histories, and other showes of welcome,
maruellous costly and sumptuous.’ He gives, however,
but a very brief statement of them in his printed
book; though in his Manuscripts, several of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
are extant in the Harleian Collection in the British Museum,
there are the very verses spoken to the Queen
on the Bridge, composed, as he says, by John Lydgate.
The Manuscript I allude to, is one to which
I have already made a reference, being No. 542, a
small quarto volume written on antique paper, in
Stow’s own plain, but minute hand-writing. In this
volume, therefore, article 16, on page 101&#8201;a, is entitled,
‘<cite>The speches in the pagiaunts at y<sup>e</sup> cominge of
Qwene Margaret wyfe to Henry the syxt of that name
Kynge of England, the 28th of Maye, 1445, y<sup>e</sup> 23rd of
his reigne</cite>.’ The first pageant, which was an allegorical
representation of Peace and Plenty, was erected at
the foot of London Bridge, and the motto attached to
it was ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingredimini et replete Terram</i>,’&mdash;Enter ye
and replenish the earth,&mdash;taken from Genesis ix. according
to the Vulgate Latin. The verses addressed
to Queen Margaret were as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Most Christian Princesse, by influence of grace,<br /></span>

<p>“We shall here take our leave of the poet Lydgate,
by whose descriptive verses we have illustrated
three splendid scenes in the history of London Bridge;
and I pray you, if it be but in gratitude for this single
circumstance, reject, as malignant and untrue, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
character given of him by Ritson, when he calls him
a ‘voluminous, prosaick, and drivelling Monk.’ Warton
is not only more liberal, but more just, in his
estimate, when he says that ‘no poet had greater versatility
of talents, and that he moves with equal ease
in every mode of composition.’ He admits that he
was naturally verbose and diffuse, tedious and languid:
but he asserts, also, that he had great excellence in
flowery description; that he increased the power of
the English language; and that he was the first of our
writers whose style is clothed with modern perspicuity.
‘His Muse was of universal access,’ he continues,
‘and he was not only the poet of his monastery,
but of the world.’ Alike happy in composing
a Masque, a Disguising, a May-game, a Pageant, a
Mummery, or a Carol, for Ritson’s list of his poems,
amounting to 251, embraces all these, and numerous
other subjects.</p>

<p>“The year 1450 was made memorable by the daring
insurrection of Jack Cade and the commons of Kent,
which arose, partly, out of the popular belief that the
Duke of Suffolk had caused the loss of a great portion
of France to the English Crown; and, partly, from the
pretensions of Richard, Duke of York, to the throne;
in consequence of the haughtiness, despotism, and
usurpation of Queen Margaret, and William De la
Pole, her favourite. After some vain attempts to
satisfy the commons concerning the Duke of Suffolk,
King Henry banished him from the realm for five
years; when after his embarkation his vessel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
chased by an English ship called the Nicholas, belonging
to the Constable of the Tower, by which it
was captured, the Duke seized, and his head struck
off on the side of a boat in Dover-roads; after which,
it was carelessly cast with the body upon the sands.
This murder, however, did not restore quietness to
England, for the Duke of York being thus relieved
from a powerful enemy, immediately proceeded in
his own designs upon the Crown. By his instigation,
therefore, one John Cade assumed the name of Sir
John Mortimer, of the house of March, who, in reality,
had been beheaded in 1425, on a charge of
treason. Cade was a native of Ireland, and formerly
a servant to Sir Thomas Dacre, Knight, of Sussex;
but having cruelly murdered a pregnant woman, he
took sanctuary, and forsware the kingdom. With
such a character, he began his work of reformation
in Kent, in May, 1450; assuming also, as some tell
us, the title of John Amendall, and easily drew so
many malcontents together, that, in a few days, he was
enabled to approach London, and to encamp with his
rebel forces upon Blackheath. When Henry marched
against him, he retired into a wood near Sevenoaks;
where he remained, until the King, supposing his
followers dispersed, returned to London, and contented
himself with despatching after them a detachment
of his army commanded by Sir Humphrey
Stafford; which division falling into the ambush, was
cut in pieces, and its leader slain. Elated by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
success, Cade again marched towards London, whilst
Henry and his Court retreated to Kenilworth Castle
in Warwickshire; leaving a garrison in the Tower,
under command of the Lord Scales. The rebels, however,
now became increased by multitudes, which
joined them from all parts; and on Wednesday, the
1st of July, Cade arrived in Southwark, where he
lodged at the Hart, for, says Alderman Fabyan, in his
‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ from whom Stow almost verbally copies
this story, ‘he might not be suffered to enter the
Citie.’ Jack Cade, however, had but too many friends
within the gates of London. The Commons of Essex
were already in arms, and were mustered in a field
at Mile-end; and upon a discussion in the Court of
Common-Council on the propriety of admitting the
rebels over the Bridge, the loyal-hearted Alderman
Robert Horne so incensed the populace, by speaking
warmly against the motion, that they were not reduced
to order until he was committed to Newgate.
About five o’clock then, on the afternoon of Thursday,
July 2nd, London stained her Annals by opening the
Bridge-gates to Cade, and his rabble rout. As he
crossed the Draw-bridge, he cut with his sword the
ropes which supported it; and on entering into the
City, so beguiled the inhabitants, and even Nicholas
Wilford, or Wyfold, the Lord Mayor, that he procured
a free communication between his followers and
London, though he himself again withdrew to his
lodging in Southwark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“In Shakspeare’s vivid scenes of this rebellion, in
his ‘<cite>Second Part of King Henry the Sixth</cite>,’ Act iv.,
Scene 4th, a messenger tells King Henry,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge; the Citizens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly and forsake their houses:’&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">and in the next scene a Citizen says, ‘they have won
the Bridge, killing all that withstand them.’ In
Scene 6th, Cade cries, ‘Go and set London-Bridge on
fire;’ and Edmund Malone, in his note upon this
passage, tells us, what we certainly cannot find by any
other history, that ‘at that time London Bridge was
built of <em>wood</em>;’ adding, from Hall, that ‘the houses
on London Bridge were, in this rebellion, burnt, and
many of the inhabitants perished.’ This note you may
see in the Variorum edition of ‘<cite>Shakspeare’s Plays</cite>,’
by Isaac Reed, London, 1803, 8vo., volume xiii.,
page 341. London Bridge, however, was not even
yet entirely captured, and two robberies which Cade
had committed in the City, speedily roused the
wealthier inhabitants to a sense of his outrage, and
their own danger. Whereupon, ‘what do they,’ as
honest John Bunyan says of the Captains in Mansoul,
‘but like so many Samsons shake themselves?’ and
send unto the Lord Scales, and the valiant Matthew
Gough, at the Tower, for assistance. The latter of
these commanders was appointed to aid the City,
whilst the former supported him with a frequent discharge
of ordnance; and on the night of Sunday,
July 5th, Cade being then in Southwark, the City<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Captains, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of
London mounted guard upon the Bridge. ‘The
rebelles,’ says Hall in his ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ folio lxxviii. a,
which contains the best version of the story,&mdash;‘the
rebelles, which neuer soundly slepte, for feare of
sodayne chaunces, hearing the Bridge to be kept and
manned, ran with greate haste to open the passage,
where betwene bothe partes was a ferce and cruell
encounter. Matthew Gough, more experte in marciall
feates than the other Cheuetaynes of the Citie,
perceiuing the Kentishmen better to stand to their
tacklyng than his ymagination expected, aduised his
company no farther to procede toward Southwarke,
till the day appered; to the entent, that the Citizens
hearing where the place of the ieopardye rested,
might occurre their enemies and releue their frendes
and companions. But this counsail came to smal
effect: for the multitude of the rebelles drave the
Citizens from the stoulpes,’&mdash;wooden piles,&mdash;‘at the
Bridge foote, to the Drawe-bridge, and began to set
fyre in diuers houses. Alas! what sorow it was to
beholde that miserable chaunce: for some desyringe
to eschew the fyre lept on hys enemies weapon, and
so died: fearfull women, with chyldren in their armes,
amased and appalled lept into the riuer; other,
doubtinge how to saue them self betwene fyre, water,
and swourd, were in their houses suffocate and smoldered,
yet the Captayns nothyng regarding these
chaunces, fought on this Draw-Bridg all the nyghte
valeauntly, but in conclusion the rebelles gat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Draw-Bridge and drowned many, and slew John
Sutton, Alderman, and Robert Heysande, a hardy
Citizen, with many other, besyde Matthew Gough, a
man of greate wit, much experience in feates of
chiualrie, the which in continuall warres had valeauntly
serued the King, and his father, in the partes
beyond the sea. But it is often sene, that he which
many tymes hath vanquyshed his enemies in straunge
countreys, and returned agayn as a conqueror, hath
of his owne nation afterward been shamfully murdered
and brought to confusion. This hard and sore
conflict endured on the Bridge till ix. of the clocke
in the mornynge in doubtfull chaunce and Fortune’s
balaunce: for some tyme the Londoners were bet
back to the stulpes at Sainct Magnes Corner; and
sodaynly agayne the rebelles were repulsed and
dryuen back to the stulpes in Southwarke, so that
both partes beynge faynte, wery, and fatygate,
agreed to desist from fight, and to leue battayll till
the next day, vpon condition that neyther Londoners
shoulde passe into Southwarke, nor the Kentish men
into London.’ William Rastall, who produced his
curious Chronicle, called ‘<cite>The Pastimes of People</cite>,’
in the year 1529, adds to this account, that ‘the
Kentysshemen brent the Brydge;’ see page 265 of
the excellent edition of that work, by the Rev. T. F.
Dibdin, D. D. &amp;c. London, 1811, quarto.</p>

<p>“During the truce that followed this most valiant
defence of London Bridge, and which nearly effaced
the deep stain of the Citizens opening their gates to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
a rebel, a general pardon was procured for Cade
and his followers, by John Stafford, Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord High Chancellor. Upon which,
some accepted of the King’s grace, and all began, by
degrees, to withdraw from Southwark with their
spoil, whilst Cade himself was soon after slain by
Alexander Iden, Esquire, of Kent, in consequence of
a reward being offered for his apprehension. His
dead body was brought to London, and his head
erected on the Bridge-gate, where he had so recently
placed that of one of his greatest victims, Sir James
Fynes, Lord Say, Treasurer of England. Concerning
these events see also Shakspeare’s ‘<cite>Second Part of
King Henry the Sixth</cite>,’ Act iv., Scenes 7th and 10th;
Fabyan’s ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ pages 451-453; and Stow’s
‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ pages 391, 392.</p>

<p>“I have but little more to subjoin to close the history
of this rebellion; but I may add, that in January
1451, twenty-six of the Kentish rebels were tried
before the King and his Justices Itinerant, and executed
at Dover, and other places in the County; and
that on Tuesday, February 23rd, as Henry returned
to London, great numbers more met him on Blackheath,
dressed in their shirts only, and imploring his
clemency on their knees, were all pardoned. Against
his entering the City, nine heads of those who had
been executed were erected on London Bridge, that
of their leader standing in the centre. ‘This,’ says
Hall, in closing his account of Cade’s insurrection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> ‘is
the successe of all rebelles, and this fortune chaunceth
ever to traytors: for where men striue against the
streame, their bote neuer cometh to his pretensed
porte.’</p>

<p>“In June 1461, previously to his Coronation, King
Edward IV. crossed London Bridge with some ceremony,
on the way from his Palace of Sheen to the
Tower; whence it was anciently customary for the
English Sovereigns to ride to Westminster in solemn
procession the day before they were crowned. We
have this information in an article printed by Hearne,
and attached to his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thom&aelig; Sprotti Chronica</cite>.’ Oxford,
1719, 8vo. It is entitled ‘<cite>A remarkable Fragment of
an old English Chronicle, or History of the Affairs of
King Edward the Fourth, Transcrib’d from an old MS</cite>.;’
and on page 288, we find the following particulars.
‘The same xxvi<sup>th</sup> of Juny, the King Edward movid
from Sheene towardis London, then being Thursday;’&mdash;in
reality though it was Friday, as this very extract
subsequently shews&mdash;‘and upon the way receyvid
him the Maire and his brethirn all in scarle, with
iiii c commoners well horsid and cladde in grene, and
so avauncing theime self passid the Bridge, and
thurgh the Cite they rode streigte unto the Toure of
London, and restid there all nigt.’ The day following,
King Edward made 32 Companions of the Bath.
He then proceeded to Westminster, attended by
the new Knights habited in the white silk dress of the
Order; and on the morrow,&mdash;which was St. Peter’s
day, and Sunday,&mdash;he was crowned at Westminster
by Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“The revenues of London Bridge seem greatly to
have flourished under the reign of this Sovereign,
for in his 5th year, 1465, the Wardens of the same,
Peter Alford and Peter Caldecot, paid, on account
thereof, the immense sum of &pound;731. 10<em>s.</em> 1&frac12;; as you
may see in Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., page 48,
which information he has quoted from Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>.’
You, doubtless, remember, that although Edward IV.
was, at this period of our history, seated on the English
throne, yet that King Henry VI. was only deposed
by the partizans of Edward Plantagenet, Earl of March,
and son to the late Duke of York, and the Earl of
Warwick, in March, 1461. In October 1470, therefore,
Henry was again restored to his crown, which
he retained with a disturbed sway for seven months
only, and in April, 1471, was again imprisoned in the
Tower, whence he had been taken to remount the
throne. There were, however, not even then wanting
some zealous adherents to the declining House of
Lancaster, who made several brave, though unavailing
efforts on the behalf of King Henry, Margaret of
Anjou, and the young Edward, Prince of Wales.
Under the sanction of their cause an impudent attack
was made upon London in 1471, which forms an important
feature in the history of this Bridge; which
being mentioned by Stow in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 61, is thence copied by all who have written its
Annals. The Earl of Warwick had appointed to be
Vice-Admiral of the Channel, one Thomas Neville,
an illegitimate son to William, Lord Falconbridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and thence called ‘the Bastard of Falconbridge.’
When he lost this employment, as he was a man
alike devoid of morals and of money, he saw, says
Rapin, with a very singular expression, ‘no other way
to subsist than turning Pirate;’ for which, however,
he probably required very little transmutation. As
Edward was, at this time, engaged in pursuit of Elizabeth,
his Queen, Falconbridge collected some ships,
and a number of persons of desperate fortunes, and
landing on the coast of Kent, intended no less than
to surprise London, and enrich himself with the
plunder of the City. He arrived in Southwark in
May, giving out that he came to free King Henry
from his captivity, and soon becoming possessed of
that place, on Tuesday, the 14th, he ordered 3000 of
his followers to cross the river in boats, and assault
Ald-Gate and Bishops-Gate, whilst he himself attempted
to force the Bridge. This he endeavoured to
effect by firing it, by which he destroyed sixty houses
standing upon it; though the Citizens were so well
provided with ordnance, that even if the passage had
been entirely open, says an ancient Chronicler, ‘they
should have had hard entering that way.’ It is singular,
however, that in this account of the number
of the houses burned on London Bridge, Stow should
be so greatly at variance with the earlier Historians;
since they state it to be sixty, whilst, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
he says only that Falconbridge ‘burned the Gate and
all the houses to the Draw-Bridge, being at that time
<em>thirteen</em> in number.’ It is, perhaps, possible that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
old Citizen is in the right; and that the other Annalists
include some of those buildings which were
destroyed in the suburbs of Southwark.</p>

<p>“One of the bravest defenders of London Bridge
was Ralph Joceline, Alderman and Draper, afterwards
made a Knight of the Bath, and Lord Mayor,
in 1464 and 1476; since he not only manfully resisted
Falconbridge and his party, when they attacked the
Draw-Bridge, but upon their retiring, as they were
at last forced to do, as well from the City as from the
Bridge, he sallied forth upon them, and following them
along the water-side beyond Ratcliffe, slew and captured
very many of them. The Arms of this worthy
were Azure, a mullet within a circular wreath Argent
and Sable, having four hawk’s bells joined thereto
in quadrature, Or. I have given you these particulars
from Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 424; from Holinshed’s
‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ volume ii., page 690; and from Fabyan’s
‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ page 590; in which last authority it is
added that ‘the Bastarde, with his shipmen, wer
chased vnto their shippes lying at Blackewall, and
there in the chase many slaine. And the saied Bastarde,
the night followyng, stale out his shippes out
of the riuer and so departed, and escaped for that
tyme.’</p>

<p>“Another record of the destruction of part of
London Bridge, marks the year 1481, for page 61 of
volume i. of Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ informs us, that a house
called ‘<em>the Common Stage</em>,’ then fell down into the
Thames, and by its fall five men were drowned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
What this building really was, you may see in Holinshed’s
‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ volume ii., page 705, where this
fact is quoted from the volume entitled ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scala Temporum</cite>,’
or, the Ladder of the Times, a contemporary
record of remarkable occurrences.</p>

<p>“We are indebted to that singularly curious work,
known by the name of ‘<cite>Arnold’s Chronicle</cite>,’ for an
account of the expenses of London Bridge in several
of the latter years of the fifteenth century, beginning
with 1482, and terminating with 1494. The best
edition of this volume is that edited by Francis Douce,
Esq., London, 1811, quarto, for the series of modern
reprints of ancient English Chronicles, which appeared
about that time. The modern title of the
book is ‘<cite>The Customs of London, otherwise called
Arnold’s Chronicle</cite>;’ but in its original state it was
devoid of a Title-page, the Table of Contents being
headed thus: ‘In this booke is conteyned the names
of y<sup>e</sup> Bayliffs, Custos, Mairs, and Sherefs of the Cite
of London, from the tyme of King Richard the
Furst; and also th’ Artycles of the Chartur and
Libarties of the same Cyte; and of the Chartur and
Libarties off England, wyth odur dyuers matters
good for euery Citezen to vndirstond and knowe;
whiche ben shewid in Chaptirs after the fourme of
this kalendir following.’ The first edition of ‘<cite>Arnold’s
Chronicle</cite>’ is usually supposed to have been printed
by John Doesborowe, at Antwerp, about the year
1502, in small folio; though it is without either date,
or name of place, or Printer. It seems that Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Arnold himself was a Citizen and Haberdasher, who
resided in the Parish of St. Magnus, London Bridge,
where he flourished in the year 1519. His work is
a most singular compilation, for it not only contains
all the subjects which I have already named to you,
but numerous others which seem to have no sort
of connection with it: such, for instance, as forms
for legal instruments, ‘the crafte to make a water to
haue spottys out of clothe;’&mdash;‘the vij &aelig;gesse of the
worlde fro Adam forewarde;’&mdash;‘the crafte of graffyng
and plantyng of tryes;’&mdash;‘to make a pickell too kepe
fresh sturgeon in;’ and the ancient original of Prior’s
beautiful ballad of the Nut-brown Maid! But now
to shew you its references to London Bridge in particular,
I must observe that one of its articles is entitled
‘The lerning for to make a count by y<sup>e</sup> yerly
rentis of London Brygge, Fo. 270;’ nearly all of
Arnold’s examples being given from real and public
documents: indeed, he was, as Mr. Douce observes
of him, ‘a very active, and even a meddling character.’
To that activity and meddling, however, we
owe too much extremely valuable information, to visit
his sins of officious curiosity with any very severe
censure; or to blame him too violently for having
compiled his volume of such very singular materials.
The first extract from these Account-rolls is for 1482,

<p>“I regret, Mr. Barbican, and I am very sure that <em>you</em>
do, that our Bridge Annals must, for some few years,
be carried on principally by these documents; for I
do not, in my limited reading, find any more interesting
matter to record in them. Thus much, however,
may be said in their defence, that we may certainly
learn from them the increasing prosperity of the
Bridge, and discover, in the items of their charges,
many a curious fragment of the ancient value of
money, and the articles contained in them. Having
thus then, Mr. Geoffrey, deprecated your wrath
against these matters, which certainly are somewhat
dull in the recital, I proceed to the accounts of
London Bridge for the years 1483-85, as they are

omit to notice, before quitting these particulars of the
ancient expenses of London Bridge, that they are to
be found also printed in Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume
i., pages 48, 49.</p>

<p>“We have frequently, in the course of these fragmenta,
mentioned various officers set over the affairs
of London Bridge, and some of the instruments
which I have quoted, have shewn that several of them
were anciently appointed by the King’s Writ or
Patent. The principal of these Officers are two
Bridge-Masters, having certain fees and profits, yearly
elected, or continued, by the Livery at the Common
Hall, held upon Midsummer day, after the Sheriffs
and Chamberlain. Strype, the continuator of Stow’s
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ whose signature is J. S., states, in volume ii.,
page 25, that the Bridge-Master is some freeman
elected by the City and set over the Bridge-House,
‘to look after the reparations of the Bridge;’ he adds,
too, that ‘he hath a liberal salary allowed him; and
that the place hath sometimes been a good relief for
some honest citizens fallen to decay.’ We are also
farther told by the same author, on page 472 of the
same work and volume, that at a Court of Common
Council, held on Friday, April 15th, 1491, in the 6th
year of King Henry VII., it was enacted that at the
election of Bridge-Master, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
should annually present four men to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Commonalty, from whom they were to elect two to
be Bridge-Masters. This act appears to have been in
force until Thursday, April the 15th, 1643, when it
was repealed, and the whole election has since remained
in the Livery. Of the names and ancient fees
of these Bridge-Masters I have already given you
some specimens, and shall cite you several others in
the future years of our history.</p>

<p>“We must again be indebted to ‘<cite>Arnold’s Chronicle</cite>’
for a fragment illustrative of the property,
persons, and houses, in the Parish of St. Magnus,
and on London Bridge, in the year 1494; for on page
224 of that mass of singular information, we find an
article entitled ‘<cite>The Valew and stynt of the Benefyce
of St. Magnus at London Brydge yerly to the Person.
The Rekenyng of the same the fyrst day of Decembre,
Anno Domini</cite> M. CCCC. lxxxxiiij.’ I am not going to
give you the long bead-roll of names, rents, and
rates which follow; but I shall observe that, at this
period, the rents amounted to &pound;434. 12<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>, and the
offerings paid to the Parson came to &pound;75. 8<em>s.</em> 8&frac12;<em>d.</em>
The rent of ‘the Shoppis in Brig-strett,’ amounted
to &pound;70. 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>, and their offerings to &pound;12. 3<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em>; but
the only building that is mentioned as immediately
connected with our present subject is ‘the Ymage
of our Lady on the Brydge, valet iiij marke,’ or
&pound;2. 13<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> You may, perhaps, remember that this
very article from ‘<cite>Arnold’s Chronicle</cite>,’ was afterwards
printed in a small volume commonly supposed to have
been compiled by the learned Dr. Brian Walton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Bishop of Chester, and Editor of the famous London
Polyglot Bible, in 1657. This tract is entitled ‘<cite>A
Treatise concerning the payment of Tythes and Oblations
in London. By B. W., D. D.</cite>;’ 1641, 4to., and
the original manuscript, written in an ancient hand on
folio paper, is, to our delight, yet remaining in the
Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth Palace, No. 273.
Whilst I am speaking of this collection, I may observe
that it contains another manuscript in which are some
few curious particulars concerning the buildings on
London Bridge. This is marked No. 272; was written
in 1638, on folio paper; and is entitled ‘<cite>A Catalogue
of inhabitants of the several Parishes in London, with
the rent of houses and tythes paid out of them; in order
to a new settlement of Tythes</cite>.’ The contents of this
manuscript set forth not only the names of the
dwellers in the various houses, but also ‘a moderate
valuacion’ of them, ‘and other things tithable;’
wherein, however, it is added, of St. Magnus, that ‘the
Parish would not ioyne.’ This district forms article
48 of the volume, and we find mentioned in it the
following buildings ‘on London Bridge.’ ‘One great
house, shop, warehouse, cellars, &amp;c. clear value &pound;50.,
Tithes, &pound;1. 16<em>s.</em>; it hath bin letten for above &pound;8.’&mdash;‘One
faire house and shop, part of the Little Nonesuch,’
value &pound;40., Tythes, &pound;1. 7<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; and the same
for the other part. ‘One Ale-cellar, Tythes, 3<em>s.</em>’ On
the South side of Great Thames Street, the following
buildings are mentioned connected with the Bridge:
‘One house, wharf, and Engines to carry water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
valued at &pound;500. cleere profitt.’&mdash;‘One great house
divided into divers tenements, Bridge-House Rents,
over them, value &pound;20.’</p>

<p>“In giving you these particulars, I must own that
I have considerably anticipated the period to which
they belong, but as it is my wish to say something of
the history of St. Magnus’ Parish, it could scarcely
be more properly introduced than when we were
noticing the ancient amount of its tythes, &amp;c. The
earliest mention of the Church of St. Magnus is said
by Pennant to be in 1433, though Stow speaks of several
monuments considerably older; and if you will turn
to Newcourt’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Repertorium Ecclesiasticum</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 396, you will find that Hugh Pourt, one of the
Sheriffs of London, in 1302, and Margaret his wife,
founded a perpetual Chantry in this edifice: and
further, that the list of Rectors commences with
Robert de Sancto Albano, who resigned his office on
the 31st of August, 1323. There was also a Guild, or
Fraternity, called ‘Le Salve Regina,’ held in this
Church, as Stow shows you in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 495, which was flourishing in the 17th year of
Edward III.,&mdash;1343.&mdash;The intent of that convention
will best be shewn by an extract from Stow’s translation
of the certificate of this species of religious
Benefit Society, which is as follows:&mdash;‘Be it remembered
that Rauf Capeleyn, du Bailiff; William
Double, Fishmonger; Roger Lowher, Chancellor;
Henry Boseworth, Vintener; Stephen Lucas, Stock-Fishmonger;
and other of the better sort of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Parish of St. Magnus, near the Bridge of London,
of their great devotion, and to the honour of God and
his glorious Mother, our Lady Mary the Virgin,
began, and caused to be made a Chantry, to sing an
Anthem of our Lady called ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salve Regina</cite>,’ every
evening: and thereupon ordained five burning wax
lights at the time of the said anthem, in the honour
and reverence of the five principal joys of our Lady
aforesaid, and for exciting the people to devotion at
such an hour, the more to merit to their souls. And
thereupon many other good people of the same Parish,
seeing the great honesty of the said service and devotion,
proferred to be aiders and parteners to support
the said lights and the said anthem to be continually
sung; paying to every person every week an halfpenny.
And so that hereafter, with the gift that the
people shall give to the sustentation of the said light
and anthem, there shall be to find a Chaplain singing
in the said Church for all the benefactors of the said
light and anthem.’</p>

<p>“I do not find that the Patron Saint of this edifice
is at all mentioned by Alban Butler; nor are all
writers perfectly agreed as to who he actually was;
seeing that there were two Saints named Magnus,
whose festival day was kept on the 19th of August.
One of these was Bishop of Anagnia in Italy, and
was martyred in the persecution raised by the Emperors
Decius and Valerian, about the middle of the
third century after the Birth of Christ. The other
St. Magnus; was the person to whom Newcourt supposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
this Church was dedicated, though he erroneously
calls his feast August the 18th. He is named,
by way of distinction, St. Magnus the Martyr of
C&aelig;sarea, in Cappadocia, because he suffered at that
City, under Alexander the Governor, in the time of
the Emperor Aurelian, A. D. 276. Having vainly
endeavoured to make him do sacrifice, he caused him
to be twice exposed to the flames of a furnace, and
thrice to be thrown to wild beasts; but none of these
things moving him, he was at length stoned, and
when all imagined that he was dead, he suddenly
prayed that his soul might have a peaceful exit, and
presently gave up the ghost. An extended history of
these famous men, you will find in that wonderful
work the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Sanctorum</cite>,’ which I have before
quoted, in the third volume for August, pages
701-719: though there is a much longer account of
the Swedish St. Magnus, the Abbot, whose festival is
September the 6th, and whom I pray you never to
mistake for the Martyr of London Bridge. The
Rectory of St. Magnus, says the tract which I last
quoted from the Lambeth Library, is rated higher in
his Majesty’s books than any living in, or about,
London, being valued at &pound;69. and 40<em>s.</em> more in
pensions, but is without any glebe attached to it.
Before I close these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spicilegia</i> of the rents, &amp;c. of St.
Magnus and London Bridge, I must observe to you
that when Arnold is speaking in his ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>’ of the
fifteenths raised by every Ward in London, he states,
at page 48, that the quarter of the Bridge itself, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
a fifteenth, amounted to &pound;14. 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>; and that the
Bridge-street quarter produced &pound;11. 5<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> So much
then for a few particulars of the history of this
Church and Parish, the North-East boundary of
London Bridge, to the Chronicles of which we shall
now return, taking them up again with the year
1497.</p>

<p>“It was in this year, you may remember, that the
forces of Henry VII., which were proceeding to Scotland,
were suddenly recalled to subdue a commotion
raised in Cornwall, in consequence of a subsidy voted
by Parliament, in 1496. The rebels were headed by
one Thomas Flamoke, a Lawyer and a gentleman; and
a Blacksmith, or Farrier, of Bodmin, called Michael
Joseph; both of them, says Stow, in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’
page 479, ‘men of stout stomackes.’ Under these
leaders, then, they penetrated even to Blackheath, but
on their march were so valiantly opposed in Kent,
that numbers of the insurgents fled from their company.
On Blackheath the Royal troops were already
encamped under several valiant commanders, by
whom the rebels’ retreat was immediately cut off; and
in a short engagement which ensued on June the
22nd, Flamoke and Joseph were both taken prisoners.
On the 28th following they were executed at
Tyburn; and their quarters were to have been
erected in various places in Cornwall, but Hall states,
in his ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ folio 43&#8201;b, that, as it was supposed
it would incite the Cornishmen to new insurrections,
they were set up in London: and their heads greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Henry VII. on London Bridge, as he triumphantly
returned over it from Blackheath.</p>

<div>
<p>“During this same year, London Bridge appears
to have been repaired to some extent, although it is
probable that the only notice of it may exist in the
manuscript records of the Bridge Comptroller. In
the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,’ however, for October
1758, volume xxviii., page 469, is a Letter from
Joseph Ames, Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries,
and Author of the ‘<cite>Typographical Antiquities</cite>,’ containing
three inscriptions engraven on stone, found in
pulling down a part of the edifice. These, it is supposed,
were laid in the building at the different times
of its repair, specified by their several dates; but
though so very ancient, yet the descriptive account
states that, ‘they are all as fresh as if new cut;’ they
being then in the possession of Mr. Hudson, the
Bridge-Master. The oldest inscription is sculptured
upon a stone 9&frac34; inches in height, by 16&frac34; inches long;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="pc">the letters being raised and blacked, and the words,
within a border, being ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anno Domini</i>,’ with the date
of 1497, in small black-letters, and ancient Arabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
figures. I shall introduce the other stones to your
notice in the years to which they refer; and only now
remark, that they are engraven in Plate 1, Numbers
I. II. III. page 470, of the work to which I have already
referred you, whence they were copied into
Gough’s ‘<cite>Sepulchral Monuments</cite>,’ volume ii., part i.,
page cclxvi., plate xxv.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>“Hitherto, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, I have quoted
you an abundance of authorities which make mention
of the history, or appearance, of London Bridge, but
notwithstanding my researches I find only a very few
ancient representations of it. If, however, you would
see an interesting and sweetly-touched portraiture of
it about the year 1500, look into that stout roan-coated
folio, marked 16&#8201;F. ii. xv. in the Royal Library
of Manuscripts in the British Museum, and you will
be enraptured. The volume professes to treat of
‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grace enti&eacute;re sur le gouvernement du Prince</i>,’ and it
is written in prose and verse, in the common large
black script of the fifteenth century, on vellum, with
most noble illuminations, executed in the best style of
the best period of the art in England, and by one of
the most gifted of the Brethren of St. Luke. The
Author of the poems was Charles, Duke of Orleans,
father of Louis XII.; and this particular copy of his
works seems to have been illuminated for Henry the
Eighth, when Prince of Wales; for it not only contains
numerous initial letters and borders richly coloured
and embossed with gold; but in the frontispiece,
on the first page, are his father’s well known
badges of the red and white roses; the former of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
which are supported by the white hound, and red
dragon: with glorified white roses in the margin.
The poems are divided into several books of various
amatory subjects, as ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Venus et Cupidon</i>,’&mdash;‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Epitres
d’Abelard et Eloise</i>,’&mdash;‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Demandes d’Amours</i>;’ and
the second division of the volume is adorned with a
large and beautiful illumination representing the
Duke of Orleans in the Tower, sending despatches to
his friends abroad. The Tower, wharf, and river
before them, occupy the whole foreground of the
painting; and in the back appears the East side of
London Bridge, with numerous houses standing upon
it, the Chapel of St. Thomas reaching down to the
sterlings, and the violent fall of the river through the
different arches; whilst, beyond it, rise the spires of
several Churches, especially the very high one of old
St. Paul’s, and the other buildings of London erected
along the banks of the Thames. It is, indeed, hardly
possible to give you an adequate idea of the spirit and
beauty of this view of <span class="smcap">London Bridge in the Year
1500</span>,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc">the colouring is so vivid and harmonious: a sky of
ultra-marine blue is spread over the whole of the
back-ground, against which the distant buildings
appear in white, the nearer ones being touched with
different shades of brown. You will, however, find
a fair copy of this noble painting, engraved by Basire,
in Gough’s ‘<cite>History of Pleshy</cite>,’ which I have already
cited, page 193; and the <em>same plate</em> has also been
published as an additional illustration to the Rev. T.
D. Fosbrooke’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia of Antiquities</cite>,’ London,
1825, volume ii., page 923.</p>
</div>

<p>“You must, doubtless, recollect that in November
1501, Arthur, Prince of Wales, and son to King
Henry VII., was married to Katherine, daughter of
Ferdinand V., King of Spain, and that on Friday, the
12th of that month, the young Princess was conveyed
from Lambeth, through London, to witness the pageants
which had been prepared by the Citizens to
do honour to her nuptials. The whole City was full
of triumph and splendour; and Stow, in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’
page 482, says that on London Bridge there was ordained
a costly pageant of St. Katherine and St. Ursula,
with many virgins. ‘I passe ouer,’ says Hall,
in a very brilliant paragraph, folio, liii&#8201;a, and using
that most powerful oratorical figure called Paralepsis,
or Omission, which declares that of which it denies
saying any thing:&mdash;‘I passe ouer,’ says the old Chronicler,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>‘the
wyse deuises, the prudent speches, the
costly woorkes, the conninge portratures practised
and set foorth in vij goodly beautifull pageauntes
erected and set vp in diuers places of the Cite.
I leaue also the goodly ballades, the swete armony,
the musicall instrumentes, which sounded with heavenly
noyes on every side of the strete. I omit
farther the costly apparel both of goldsmythes
woorke and embraudery, the riche jewelles, the
massy cheynes, the styrrynge horsses, the beautifull
bardes and the glytteryng trappers bothe with belles
and spangles of golde. I pretermyt also the ryche
apparell of the Pryncesse, the straunge fasshion of
the Spanishe nacion, the beauty of the Englishe
ladyes, the goodly demeanoure of the young damoselles,
the amourous countenaunce of the lusty
bachelers. I passe ouer also the fyne engrayned
clothes, the costly furres of the Citizens standing on
skaffoldes, rayled from Gracechurche to Paules.
What should I speake of the oderiferous skarlettes,
the fyne veluet, the plesaunt furres, the massye
chaynes, which the Mayre of London with the Senate,
sitting on horseback, at the Litle Condyte in Chepe,
ware on their bodyes, and about their neckes. I will
not molest you with rehersyng the ryche arras, the
costly tapestry, the fyne clothes bothe of golde and
syluer, the curious veluettes, the beautiful sattens,
nor the pleasaunt sylkes, which did hang in every
strete wher she passed, the wyne that ranne continually
out of the condytes, the graueling and rayling
of the stretes nedeth not to be remembered.’ I have
given you the whole of this fine, but certainly extended,
extract, that you may derive from it some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
general idea of the pageantry of this festival, concerning
which our Bridge historians are, in general,
altogether silent.</p>

<div>
<p>“The night of Thursday, November 21st, 1504,
was rendered memorable by a dreadful Fire, which
commenced at the sign of the Pannier, at the Northern
end of London Bridge, where six tenements were consumed,
‘that could not be quenched.’ Fabyan and
Holinshed tell us this in their ‘<cite>Chronicles</cite>,’ page 534
and volume II., page 791; adding, that on the 7th
of the following month certain other houses were
also destroyed, near St. Botolph’s Church, in Thames
Street. It was, probably, when the repairs occasioned
by these conflagrations were completed, that another
of those sculptured stones which I lately mentioned,
was placed at the Bridge. It measures 10 inches in
height, by 13&frac34; inches broad; and, carved in the same
characters, and figures, as the former, are the words
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anno Domini</i> 1509.’ At the end of the date is an
arbitrary mark of a cross charged with a small saltire,
which is supposed to have been the old device for
Southwark, or the estate of London Bridge: and you
know that the Arms used for those places are still
Azure, an Annulet, ensigned with a Cross pate&eacute;, Or
interlaced with a saltire conjoined in base, of the
second. I have yet to mention a third sculptured
stone, which, it is supposed, records the public benefits
conferred by Sir Roger Achiley, Draper, upon
the City during his Mayoralty in 1511. This tablet
is 11&frac12; inches wide, by 9&frac12; high; and the inscription is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anno</i>’&mdash;the City sword&mdash;‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domini.</i> R. 1514 A;’
these letters being the initials of that very eminent
Citizen, who was then senior Alderman, representing
the Ward of Bridge Within. Such were the other two
<span class="smcap">Ancient stones found at London Bridge in 1758</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>“I have already mentioned to you the situation,
and general intent, of the Bridge-House and Yard,
and I have now to remark, that they seem, at a very
early period, to have been used for the erection of
Granaries for the City to preserve Corn, &amp;c. in, during
the times of famine and scarcity of provisions. This
information we derive from Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume ii.,
page 24; where he adds, that there were also certain
public ovens built in the same places, for the baking
of such bread-corn as was there laid up, for the relief
of the poor Citizens at such seasons. These ovens
were ten in number, six of them being very large,
and the remainder only half the size; and for their
erection, Stow observes, that John Throstone, or
Thurston, Citizen and Goldsmith, one of the Sheriffs
in 1516, gave, by his testament, the sum of &pound;200.</p>

<p>“We have now arrived at the days of King Henry
the Eighth, about the period when Pope Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the Sixth sent over the celebrated Polydore Vergil to
receive the tribute called Peter-pence, of which he
was the last Collector in England. As he was already
celebrated for his Poems and his books, ‘<cite>On the Invention
of Things</cite>,’ and ‘<cite>on Prodigies</cite>,’ he met with
great encouragement in this country; where he not
only received several ecclesiastical preferments, being
made Archdeacon of Wells, and Prebendary of St.
Paul’s, but in 1521 he was employed by the King to
write a History of England, which he performed in
most elegant Latin, and which was first printed at
Basil, bearing the date of 1533 for 1534. He left
England in 1550, and died at his birth-place, Urbino,
in Italy, in 1555. The best edition of this work,
entitled ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polydori Vergilii Urbinatis Histori&aelig; Angli&aelig;</cite>,’
which contains a descriptive eulogy on London
Bridge, is that of Leyden, 1651, octavo;&mdash;though I
quote from the Basil folio of 1570,&mdash;and if you turn
to page 4 of that volume, you will find the passage
commencing ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Is fluvius am&oelig;nissimus</i>,’ &amp;c. of which I
shall attempt to give you a translation. ‘This most
delightful river’&mdash;the Thames,&mdash;‘rises a little above
the road to Winchcomb, whence flowing several ways,
it is first increased at Oxford; and the beautiful
wonder, having washed the City of London, pours
itself into the Gallic Ocean, who welcomes it into the
impetuous waves of his seas; from which, twice in the
space of twenty-four hours, it flows and returns more
than the distance of sixty miles, and is of the greatest
national advantage, for, by it, merchandise may easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
be returned to the City. In this River there is a
stone Bridge, certainly a most wonderful work! for
it is erected upon twenty square piers of stone, 60
feet in height, 30 feet in breadth, and distant from
each other about 20 feet, united by arches. Upon
both sides of the Bridge there are houses erected, so
that it might appear not to be a Bridge, but one substantial
and uninterrupted street.’ The same author,
at page 25 of the same ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ says farther of
London Bridge:&mdash;‘This part of the City, which looks
Southward, is washed by the River Thames, in which
stands the Bridge, as we have said before, leading
towards Kent, erected upon 19 arches, and having a
series of extensive magnificent houses standing upon
both sides of it.’&mdash;But I fear you are drowsy, Mr. Barbican;
take another draught of the sack, good Master
Geoffrey, and then we’ll to it again.”</p>

<p>“Eh!&mdash;What!”&mdash;said I, starting up and shaking
myself, “drowsy, did you say? Oh no! Heaven defend
that I should be drowsy, when a gentleman of
your inveterate learning and lungs condescends to give
me a lecture! I was, indeed, for a moment thinking
of the Chinese devotee who vowed never to sleep at
all, and so cut off his eyelids: but I never slept,
my ancient; I never winked over your homily, though
I would fain have you come to your nineteenthly,
lastly, and to conclude. However, whilst we live we
must drink, and so here’s to your reformation, friend
Postern. Now, by St. Thomas of the Bridge!” ejaculated
I, as I took up the tankard, “you’re either a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
wizard, Master Barnaby, or else this tankard hath no
bottom; and, truly, it’s the first time I ever saw wine
keep hot on a mahogany table.”</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“Fancy, Mr. Geoffrey, mere fancy,” replied the
placid old man with a shrewd smile; “but even as it
is, it will serve as a good prelude to some of the more
amusing scenes with which the fragments of Bridge
history furnish us in the sixteenth century. Indeed,
all I have been able to lay before you are but fragments:
cyphers which derive their value by connection,
and look considerable only by their number.</p>

<p>“It was then in the year 1526, when Cardinal
Wolsey was meditating a marriage between King
Henry VIII., and the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on, that his
adversaries had anxiously contrived for him to be
despatched on an embassy to France, in order to remove
him from about the throne, or, at the least, to
weaken his power. On July the 26th, the Cardinal
left England, and in that extraordinary and entertaining
piece of biography, called ‘<cite>Cavendish’s Life
of Cardinal Wolsey</cite>,’ we have a particular account of
the grand procession in which he rode through the
City to cross London Bridge, on his road to Dover.
The best edition of this work is, past question, that
by Samuel Weller Singer, Esq., 1825, octavo, 2 volumes;
in the first of which, at page 86, you may see
an engraving of the Cardinal’s progress, from a Manuscript
in the possession of Francis Douce, Esq.,
and read the passage I have alluded to in the following
words. ‘Then marched he forward out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
his own house at Westminster, passing all through
London, over London Bridge, having before him of
gentlemen a great number, three in a rank, in black
velvet livery coats, and the most part of them with
great chains of gold about their necks. And all his
yeomen, with noblemen’s and gentlemen’s servants following
him in French tawny livery coats; having embroidered
upon the backs and breasts of the said coats
these letters: T. and C., under the Cardinal’s hat.
His sumpter mules, which were twenty in number and
more, with his carts and other carriages of his train,
were passed on before, conducted and guarded with a
great number of bows and spears. He rode like a
Cardinal, very sumptuously, on a mule trapped with
crimson velvet upon velvet, and his stirrups of copper
and gilt; and his spare mule following him with like
apparel. And before him he had his two great
crosses of silver, two great pillars of silver, the Great
Seal of England, the Cardinal’s Hat, and a gentleman
that carried his valaunce, otherwise called a cloak-bag;
which was made altogether of fine scarlet cloth,
embroidered over and over with cloth of gold very
richly, having in it a cloak of fine scarlet. Thus
passed he through London, and all the way of his
journey, having his harbingers passing before to provide
lodging for his train.’</p>

<p>“As the Account Rolls of the Bridge estates, in
1533, furnish us with a very good conception of its
prosperity and revenues at that period, I shall request
you to listen to only a very short abstract of the charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
as they appear upon a printed document which I have
already quoted. ‘1533, Thomas Crull and Robert

<p>“I have next to speak of an event occurring on
London Bridge, in 1536, which is probably better
known, and more often related, than most other portions
of its history; I allude, as you will guess, to the
anecdote of Edward Osborne leaping into the Thames
from the window of one of the Bridge Houses, to
rescue his master’s daughter. The particulars of this
circumstance are given by Stow in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume
ii., page 226, in the list of Lords Mayors of
London; when having arrived at the year 1559,
and the Mayoralty of Sir William Hewet, a Cloth-worker,
he farther speaks of him as follows:&mdash;‘This
Mayor was a Merchant, possessed of a great estate,
of &pound;6000 per Annum; and was said to have had
three sons and one daughter,’&mdash;Anne,&mdash;‘to which
daughter this mischance happened, the father then
living upon London Bridge. The maid playing with
her out of a window over the River Thames, by
chance dropped her in, almost beyond expectation of
her being saved. A young gentleman, named Osborne,
then Apprentice to Sir William, the father,
which Osborne was one of the ancestors of the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of Leeds, in a direct line, at this calamitous accident
leaped in, and saved the child. In memory of which
deliverance, and in gratitude, her father afterwards
bestowed her on the said Mr. Osborne, with a very
great dowry, whereof the late estate of Sir Thomas
Fanshaw, in the Parish of Barking, in Essex, was a
part, as the late Duke of Leeds told the Reverend
Mr. John Hewyt, from whom I have this relation;
and together with that estate in Essex, several other
lands in the Parishes of Hartehill, and Wales, in
Yorkshire; now in the possession of the said most
noble family. All this from the old Duke’s mouth to
the said Mr. Hewyt. Also that several persons of
quality courted the said young lady, and particularly
the Earl of Shewsbury; but Sir William was pleased
to say ‘<em>Osborne saved her, and Osborne should enjoy
her</em>.’ The late Duke of Leeds, and the present family,
preserve the picture of the said Sir William, in
his habit as Lord Mayor, at Kiveton House in Yorkshire,
to this day, valuing it at &pound;300.’ Pennant, in
his collection of anecdotes, called ‘<cite>Some Account of
London</cite>,’ which I have already cited, page 322, says,
after relating this story, ‘I have seen the picture of
Osborne’s master at Kiveton, the seat of the Duke of
Leeds, a half-length on board; his dress is a black
gown furred, and red vest and sleeves, a gold chain,
and a bonnet.’ There is also an engraved portrait of
Osborne himself, said to be unique, in a series of
wood-cuts in the possession of Sir John St. Aubyn,
Bart. They consist of the portraits of forty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Lord Mayors in the time of Queen Elizabeth, reduced
copies of six of which, exclusive, however, of Osborne,
one of the most interesting, were, between the years
1794 and 1797, published by Richardson, the print-seller,
of Castle-street, and the Strand.</p>

<p>“This gallant action of Osborne has, likewise, been
the subject of a graphical record; for there is a small,
but rather uncommon, engraving of him leaping from
the window, executed for some ephemeral publication,
from a drawing by Samuel Wale. As this artist died
in 1786, it is of course but little authority as being a
representation of the fact, but it is, nevertheless, interesting
as giving a portraiture of the dwellings on
London Bridge in his time; and with this print I may
also mention one designed by the same hand, and engraved
by Charles Grignion, of the first Duke of Leeds
pointing to a portrait of Hewet’s daughter, and relating
to King Charles II. the foregoing anecdote of his
ancestor. You will find it in William Guthrie’s
‘<cite>Complete History of the Peerage of England</cite>,’ having
‘<em>vignettes at the conclusion of the history of each
family</em>,’ London, 1742, quarto, volume i., page 246.”</p>

<p>“Before you pass on to any other event, Mr.
Postern,” said I, as the old gentleman came to a period,
“let <em>me</em> say a word or two of the fortunate
hero of this anecdote. Sir Edward Osborne was the
son of Richard Osborne, of Ashford, in Kent, a person
certainly in a most respectable situation in life, if not
immediately of gentilitial dignity. He became Sheriff
of London in 1575, and Lord Mayor in 1583-84, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
25th of Queen Elizabeth, when he received the
honour of Knighthood at Westminster. ‘He dwelled,’&mdash;says
a manuscript in the Heralds’ College, to which
I have already referred, Pb. No. 22, folio 18&#8201;a,&mdash;‘in
Philpot Lane, in Sir William Hewet’s house, whose
da: and heire he married, and was buried’&mdash;in 1591,&mdash;‘at
St. Dennis in fanchurch Streete.’ His Armorial
Ensigns, according to the same authority, were Quarterly,
1st and 4th. Quarterly, Ermine and Azure, a
Cross Or; for Osborne: 2nd. Argent, 2 bars Gules,
on a Canton of the second, a Cross of the first; 3rd.
Argent, a Chevron Vert, between three annulets
Gules. To these we may add the coat of Hewet on
an Escutcheon of Pretence, it being Parted per pale,
Argent and Sable, a chevron engrailed between three
rams’ heads erased, horned Or; all counterchanged,
within a bordure engrailed Gules, bezant&eacute;e. On the
15th of August, 1675, Sir Thomas Osborne, the great-grandson
of Sir Edward, was raised to the Peerage
by the titles of Viscount Latimer, and Baron Kiveton,
in the County of York, by Patent from King Charles
the Second; on the 27th of June, in the year following,
he was created Earl of Danby; on April the 20th
1680, he was advanced to the dignity of Marquess of
Caermarthen; and he became First Duke of Leeds
on May the 4th, 1694. So much then, Mr. Postern,
for an historical and genealogical illustration of the
anecdote of the gallant apprentice of London Bridge.”</p>

<p>“I regret, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican,” recommenced
my visitor, after thanking me for having added the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
above information to his narrative, “I regret that I
have so little to lay before you, touching the state and
revenues of the Chapel of St. Thomas on London
Bridge, at the time of the Dissolution of Monasteries,
&amp;c. by the famous act of the 31st year of King
Henry VIII.,&mdash;1539,&mdash;Chapter the 13th. It does not
appear that its revenues yielded any considerable
profit to the King’s Augmentation Office; but yet it
certainly must have existed even in the form of a religious
establishment so late as that King’s reign,
because we find it mentioned in several lists of those
institutions in London made about that period;
though it does not appear in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valor Ecclesiasticus</cite>,’
also made by order of the same Monarch.
This celebrated and most authentic historical record,
was an ecclesiastical survey of England, made in pursuance
of an Act of Parliament passed in the 26th of
Henry VIII.,&mdash;1534,&mdash;chapter iii., section x., for the
payment of First Fruits, Pensions, &amp;c. to the King.
The survey was, of course, executed by Commissioners,
and many of the original returns to their enquiries are
yet preserved in the First-Fruits and Tenths’ Office, in
the Court of Exchequer: whilst the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valor Ecclesiasticus</cite>’
itself has been printed under the direction of the
Commissioners of Records, in five volumes folio, London,
1810-1821. The survey for the City of London
is contained in the first volume, in which we find
London Bridge frequently mentioned as receiving
certain reserved rents from the property of other establishments.
Thus, on page 388, column ii., in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
rents paid to divers persons by St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital in West Smithfield, 9<em>s.</em> are set down as
being paid ‘to the Master or Keeper of the Bridge
of London, out of the corner tenement at the Litill
Bayly without Ludgate.’ On page 390, column i.,
Elsyng Spital is stated to pay 33<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> to the Master
of London Bridge, out of the tenements in the Parish
of St. Benedict, Grace-Church: and on page 431,
column ii., it is recorded that the House of the Carthusians
was to pay 9<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> to the House of London
Bridge: though the Chapel of St. Thomas is never
mentioned in the valuation of St. Magnus’ Rectory,
which amounted to &pound;71. 7<em>s.</em> 3&frac12;<em>d.</em></p>

<p>“I have hardly less regret in stating our absolute
want of information relating to the Bridge Chapel at
the Dissolution, than I have to speak of that concerning
the Common Seal belonging to the officers of
London Bridge. Stow tells us, as you may remember,
in volume ii., page 25, of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> ‘at a
Common Council, July 14th, Anno 33, Henry VIII.&mdash;1540,&mdash;it
was ordered, that the Seal of the Bridge-House
should be changed; because the image of
Thomas Becket, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury,
was graven therein; and a new Seal to be made, devised
by Mr. Hall, to whom the old Seal was delivered.
<em>Note</em>, this was occasioned by a Proclamation,
which commanded the names of the Pope, and
Thomas of Becket, to be put out of all books and
monuments; which is the reason you shall see them
so blotted out in all old Chronicles, Legends, Primers,
and Service-books, printed before these times.’ Of
these erasures, the best account is in Bishop Burnet’s
‘<cite>History of the Reformation of the Church of England</cite>,’
London, 1681, folio, volume i., book iii., page 294;
where it is asserted that such alterations were but
slight, and that the old Mass-books were still in use,
until the time of Queen Mary, when the castrated
volumes were every where brought in, and destroyed;
all Parishes being compelled to furnish themselves
with new copies of the Church Offices: and Stow,
on page 191 of the second volume of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
states that in the book marked D of the City Records,
the name of St. Thomas was omitted, in pursuance of
the King’s edict.</p>

<p>“We have thus come down to the times of that
most eminent and laborious Antiquary, John Leland,
to whose works I have already made some slight
illustrative references; and the volume to which I am
now about to request your attention, is one of the
most rare, and curious, though not the greatest, of
his productions. Let me remind you, however, before
I mention the work itself, that Leland was, very probably,
born in the Parish of St. Michael le Quern,
London, in September, about the year 1506; that
he was educated at St. Paul’s School, in both the
Universities, and in France; that he made a literary
and an antiquarian tour, of amazing minuteness and
research, by virtue of a commission from King
Henry VIII., in 1533; and that he died in a state of
mental derangement, April the 18th, 1552, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
lived about five years under its heaviest pressure.
The particular volume of his writings to which I would
refer you, as containing much original and curious
matter concerning London Bridge, is a Latin poem,
written in verses of five feet, yet not strictly in pentameters,
entitled ‘<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Kykneion Asma, Cygnea Cantio</span>: A
Swan’s Song: the Author, John Leland, the Antiquary</cite>.’
Of this book there are two editions; a quarto, printed
at London in 1545; and a duodecimo, also published
here in 1658: though the poem and commentary
were again inserted in the 9th volume of Hearne’s
edition of ‘<cite>Leland’s Itinerary</cite>;’ since, as he states in
his Preface thereto, they ‘ought to be looked upon
as part of the Itinerary;’ and that they were grown so
very rare, that though twice reprinted, they had sold,
even so far back as 1712, for forty shillings in auctions.
Bishop Nicolson, in his ‘<cite>English Historical Library</cite>,’
page 3, characterises this work as ‘a poetical piece of
flattery, or a panegyric on King Henry; wherein the
author brings his Swan down the River of Thames,
from Oxford to Greenwich, describing, as she passes
along, all the towns, castles, and other places of note
within her view. And the ancient names of these,
being sometimes different from what the common herd
of writers had usually given, therefore, in his commentary
on this Poem, he alphabetically explains his
terms, and, by the bye, brings in a great deal of the
ancient geography of this island.’ The first passage
that I shall cite you from this curious volume, is from
page 8, verse 213, edition 1658; which commences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mox et nobilium domos virorum</i>;’ but as I have, for
the first time, done it into English verse, I will repeat
you only my paraphrase, rather than the original
Latin, observing that I have strictly adhered to all
the actual facts.</p>

<p>“Such then, Mr. Barbican, is my rapid version of
those interesting verses contained in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cygnea
Cantio</cite>;’ and we shall next refer to the famous passage
in the Commentary upon it, though, in order to be
perfectly explicit, I must previously mention some of
the circumstances which caused it to be written.</p>

<p>“John Bale, an intimate friend, and most fervent
admirer of Leland, admits, in the Preface attached to
his ‘<cite>New Year’s Gift</cite>,’ that he was not quite free
from the weakness of boasting and vain-glory. An
instance of this is to be found in the Commentary on
that part of the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cygnea Cantio</cite>,’ where he is speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of London Bridge; and you will find the passage
referred to in a work to which I have been greatly
indebted for these notices of Leland and his writings:&mdash;‘<cite>The
Lives of those eminent Antiquaries John Leland,
Thomas Hearne, and Anthony &agrave; Wood</cite>,’ Oxford,
1772, 8vo., volume i., page 47, where it is also stated,
that London Bridge was then the subject of much
public attention. By far the most curious reference
to Leland’s invective, however, is to be seen in an
original Letter written from Hearne to Bagford, and
preserved in the Harleian Collection of Manuscripts,
No. 5910, Part iv. at the end; whence I shall give it
you in all its original simplicity.</p>

part of your observations about London, together
with some fragments and books, and a copy of
Leland’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Encomia illustrorum virorum</cite>.’ The gentleman
who lent this copy is a person for whom I have
a great honour, and I desire you would return him
my service and thanks, altho’ I have already done
this myself in a letter I writ to him. I should be
glad to know whether he be Esq., or what other title
I may call him by, if I should have occasion to make
public mention of his name. I am extremely obliged
to you for your care and trouble, and for your readiness
to assist me. As for what Leland says about
London Bridge, ’tis in the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontifices</i> in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Com. upon the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cygnea Cantio</cite>.’ Some ignorant persons,
and particularly one, had found fault with his
making only <em>nineteen arches</em>, in London Bridge, when,
as they alleged, there were <em>twenty</em>. Mr. Leland acknowledges
there were <em>twenty cataracts</em>, or <em>passages</em>,
but observes that one of them was only a sluice, or
Draw-Bridge, and that there were only <em>nineteen stone
arches</em>. Upon this he takes occasion to animadvert in
short upon the aforesaid person, who had been so
pert, and promises to take more notice of him afterwards,
and at the same time to expose him according
to his deserts. He tells us he had survey’d the whole
City, and took notes of every thing of consequence in
it, and insinuates that he would publish a most full
and exact account of its History and Antiquities.
’Twas in this work the remarks of the aforesaid Observator
were to be fully considered; but Mr. Leland
dying before he could finish either this, or divers other
undertakings, his papers came into other hands, and
those about London (which were considerable) coming
to Mr. Stowe, many of them are published in the
Survey of London as Mr. Stowe’s own, and others are
entirely lost, or, at least, ’tis not at present known
who has the possession of them.’</p>

and London Bridge, I proceed to translate for you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
very amusing passage itself, premising only that you
will find it on page 133, in that edition of the work
which I have already cited.&mdash;‘<cite>Pontifices: Bridge
Masters</cite>, officers who derive their name from the
nature of their employment, namely, the constructing
of Bridges, or the keeping of them in order; of
whom also are the two Governors charged with the
care of London Bridge. These officers have an excellent
house in the suburb of Southwark, as well as
a storehouse containing every thing belonging to their
occupation. Rodolphus &agrave; Diceto relates in his History,
that Peter of Colechurch, a Priest, laid the
foundations of a new Bridge: but though it was at
first very inconsiderable, Royal and Civic munificence
afterwards brought it to be the edifice which it now
appears. Upon this subject, Courteous Reader, I am
assailed by a whole herd of blustering smatterers, of
whom there is one more insignificant than even the rest;
a fellow more notorious for loquacity than eloquence,
and prodigiously self-conceited; he, truly, shamelessly
asserts me to have mistaken in my enumeration
of the Arches of London Bridge. And he being, I
warrant you, a critic of rare sagacity, plucks up by
the roots, rends, and mangles, all by his own mighty
authority, an’t please you, the pretended oversight on
my part. But no more at present; for upon another
opportunity I am about to overwhelm his intolerable
stupidity, and trample down his arrogance: I merely
then reply to him, that one eye-witness is of more
value than ten hearsays. I am a Citizen of London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
nor do I repent me of my country; and I hope also
that she may never have any reason to repent her of
her son. To thee then, thou vile companion, Geta,’&mdash;the

<p class="pc">Suppose thou wert to try thy skill at searching into
that antiquity which involves this wonder of our
City? Perchance thou mayest learn something, unless
thou art half-ashamed to learn under my tuition. But
why should we not now return to the matter of the
Bridge? London Bridge then, as it extends itself
from North to South, has <em>twenty cataracts</em>; but of
<em>arches</em>, incurvated passages formed of solid stone,
there are no more than <em>nineteen</em>. That platform,
having the figure of a Bridge, made of level wooden
planks, capable of being raised or lowered by machines,
that an enemy may not find an open passage,
I neither can, nor will, nor ought reasonably to call
an arch. And yet thou wert greatly in hope of a

<p>“I have next, Mr. Barbican, to commend to your
notice the account of London Bridge and the Thames,
given to us by that most learned man and voluminous
writer, Paulus Jovius, Bishop of Nocera, an historian
who was born at Como, in Italy, in 1483, and died in
1552. The passage to which I allude, is in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Descriptio
Britanni&aelig;, Scoti&aelig;, Hyberni&aelig;, et Orchadum</cite>,’
Venice, 1548, small quarto, or octavo, page 12&#8201; a,
beginning ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed harum et denique omnium et famam
Londinum penitus obscurat</i>;’ but I shall here again
take the freedom to anticipate time a little, and give
you under one year a translation of Paulus Jovius,
and Sir Paul Hentzner’s description of the same
object; since the former is cited by the latter, and
both are excellently well rendered into English in
that very curious and rare production of the Strawberry-Hill
press, entitled ‘<cite>A Journey into England, by
Paul Hentzner, in the Year M.D.XC.VIII.</cite>,’ printed
in 1757, octavo; on page 4 of which the passage thus
commences. ‘On the South is a Bridge of stone,
800 feet in length, of wonderful work; it is supported
upon 20 piers of square stone, 60 feet high, and
30 broad, joined by arches of about 20 feet diameter.
The whole is covered on each side with houses, so
disposed as to have the appearance of a continued
street, not at all of a Bridge. Upon this is built a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
tower, on whose top the heads of such as have been
executed for high treason are placed upon iron spikes:
we counted above thirty. Paulus Jovius, in his description
of the most remarkable towns of England,
says, ‘All are obscured by London; which, in the
estimation of many, is C&aelig;sar’s City of the Trinobantes,
the capital of all Britain, famous for the commerce
of many nations; its houses are elegantly built, its
churches fine, its towers strong, and its riches and
abundance surprising. The wealth of the world is
wafted to it by the Thames, swelled by the tide, and
navigable to merchant ships, through a safe and deep
channel for 60 miles, from its mouth to the City. Its
banks are every where beautified with fine country
seats, woods, and farms; below, is the Royal Palace
of Greenwich; above, that of Richmond; and between
both, on the West of London, rise the noble buildings
of Westminster, most remarkable for the Courts of

<p>“I have given you the whole of this passage, because
it is curious in itself, most elegantly translated
by Lord Orford, and because, in the accounts of ancient
London which we derive from the foreigners
who have visited it, there is most commonly a delineation
of some feature which others have neglected;
as I shall have several opportunities of shewing you
hereafter. I have only to add at present, that Paul
Hentzner was an eminent German Counsellor and
traveller, who died in 1623; and whose work, whence
I have extracted the foregoing description, is entitled
‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itinerarium Germani&aelig;, Galli&aelig;, Angli&aelig;, et Itali&aelig;</cite>,’
&amp;c. best edition, Nuremberg, 1629, 4to. It was
written during a journey which he made through those
countries with the young Count Rhediger, with whom
he had been at the University of Strasburg; its elegance
of language is particularly remarkable, and the
part relating to England is generally considered as the
best.</p>

<p>“In the fourth year of the reign of King Edward
the Sixth,&mdash;1550,&mdash;those extensive Letters Patent
were granted to Southwark, by which the famous
Fair was instituted in that Borough, to be held on the
7th, 8th, and 9th of September. The Patent was
dated the 20th of April, and the sum of &pound;647. 2<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em>
was paid for it to the King, by the Mayor and Corporation
of London. At the time of this Fair, anciently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
called ‘Our Lady Fair in Southwark,’ the Lord
Mayor, and Sheriffs, used to ride to St. Magnus’
Church after dinner, at two o’clock in the afternoon;
the former being vested with his collar of SS., without
his hood, and all dressed in their scarlet gowns,
lined, without their cloaks. They were attended by
the Sword-Bearer wearing his embroidered cap, and
carrying ‘the Pearl Sword;’ and, at the Church, were
met by the Aldermen, all of whom, after Evening
Prayer, rode over the Bridge in procession, passed
through the Fair, and continued either to St. George’s
Church, Newington Bridge, or to the stones pointing
out the City liberties at St. Thomas of Waterings.
They then returned over the Bridge, or to the Bridge-House,
where a banquet was provided, when the
Aldermen took leave of the Lord Mayor, and, all
parties being returned home, the Bridge-Masters
gave a supper to the Lord Mayor’s officers. Stow
and his continuators are my authorities for these particulars;
see volume ii. of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ pages 5, 249.</p>

<p>“Our voyage down the stream of history, and of
time, has at length conducted us to the reign of
Queen Mary, and the year 1554; when her proposed
marriage with Philip II., of Spain, alarmed all the
nation, lest the Inquisition should be established in
England, and the people become the vassals of the
Spanish crown. But although the Protestants were
the most alarmed at this marriage, when the treaty
was made public the complaints and murmurs against
it became almost universal; and, finally, produced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
conspiracy against Mary, of which it was certainly
either the cause, or the pretence. One of the principal
leaders of this plot was Sir Thomas Wyat, a gentleman
of Kent, who had frequently been Ambassador
to Spain, where the cruelty and subtilty of the people
had alarmed him for the future fate of his own
country. As the insurrection was intended to be
general, <em>his</em> sphere of action was to be Kent;
whilst Sir Peter Carew excited a rising in Cornwall,
and the Duke of Suffolk in Warwickshire, as
being the centre of the kingdom. From too hasty
preparations, however, and too rapidly assembling his
forces, the designs of Carew were discovered before
they were entirely perfected; one of his accomplices
was arrested; and he saved himself only by deserting
the enterprise and escaping to France. This unexpected
discovery accelerated all the other measures;
for, though it was intended to await the arrival of
King Philip, to give a colour to the rebellion, Wyat,
notwithstanding he was unprepared, marched his few
followers to Maidstone, and gave out that he took up
arms to preserve England from being invaded. He
had little success on his way to London, but the
City Trained-bands being, by a man&oelig;uvre, induced to
desert to him, he arrived with about 4000 men in
Southwark, on Saturday, February the 3rd, 1553-54.
The prudence of that excellent man, Sir Thomas
White, then Lord Mayor, had, however, already prepared
for his coming; added to which, the Queen,
who remained in Guildhall, appointed Lord William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Howard Lieutenant of the City. The Draw-Bridge
at London Bridge was then cut down and thrown
into the River; the Bridge gates were shut; ramparts
and fortifications were raised around them; ordnance
was planted to defend them; and the Mayor and
Sheriffs, well armed for the conflict, commanded all
persons to shut their shops and windows, and to
stand ready harnessed at their doors for any event
which might occur. As Wyat found there was no
opposition made to him in Southwark, some of his
soldiers completely sacked the Bishop of Winchester’s
Palace, and destroyed his extensive library; whilst at
the Bridge foot he laid two pieces of ordnance, and
dug an extensive trench between the Bridge and his
forces. In order to gain an entrance to the Bridge,
Sir Thomas brake down the wall of a house adjoining
the gate, by which he ascended the leads over the
gate, and then coming down into the Porter’s lodge,
about eleven at night, he found the Porter sleeping,
but his wife, with several others, watching over a
coal fire. On beholding Wyat, they suddenly started,
when he commanded them to be silent, as they loved
their lives, and they should have no hurt; and, they
timidly yielding to him, he and some others went
upon the Bridge to reconnoitre. On the other side of
the Draw-Bridge he saw the Lord Admiral, the Lord
Mayor, Sir Andrew Judd, and one or two more in
consultation, for defence of the Bridge, as we may suppose,
by fire or torch light; and after, for some time,
carefully observing their deliberations, he returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
his party, unseen and in safety. Having stated to his
followers the active measures of the Citizens, they
began to consult what course they had better adopt
to secure their own success and safety. The advice
of some was to return to Greenwich, and crossing the
water into Essex, enter London at Aldgate; others,
though they were suspected of treachery, were for
going back into Kent to meet some friends and supplies;
when, at length, it was concluded that they
should march along the Thames towards Kingston,
and, crossing the Bridge of that place, enter the City
on the West.</p>

<p>“On the night previously to their departure,
Monday, the 5th of February, as ‘Thomas Menschen,
one of the Lieutenant’s men of the Tower,’&mdash;says Stow,
in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 619,&mdash;‘rowed with a sculler over
against the Bishop of Winchester’s Palace, there was
a water-man of the Tower stayres, desired the sayd
Lieutenant to take him in, who did so, which being
espied of Wyatt’s men, seauen of them with harquebusses
called to them to land againe, but they would
not, whereupon each man discharged their piece, and
killed the sayd Waterman, which foorthwith falling
downe dead, the sculler with much paine rowed
through the Bridge to the Tower wharfe, with the
Lieutenant’s man and the dead man in his boat;
which thing was no sooner knowne to the Lieutenant,
but even the same night, and the next morning, hee
bent seauen great pieces of ordnance, cvluerings and
demi-canons, full against the foote of the Bridge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
against Southwarke, and the two steeples of Saint
Olaues and Saint Mary Oueries, besides all the pieces
on the White Tower, one culuering on the Diueling
Tower, and three fauconets ouer the Water-gate:
which so soone as the inhabitants of Southwarke
vnderstood, certaine both men and women came to
Wyat in most lamentable wise, saying, ‘Sir, wee are
all like to bee vtterly vndone, and destroyed for
your sake, our houses shall by and by bee throwne
downe vpon our heads, to the vtter spoyle of this
borrough, with the shot of the Tower, all ready bent
and charged towards vs, for the loue of God therefore
take pittie vpon vs:’ at which wordes hee being
partly abashed, stayed a while, and then sayd: ‘I
pray you my friends bee content a while, and I will
soone ease you of this mischiefe, for God forbid that
you, or the least here, should be killed, or hurt, in
my behalfe.’ And so, in most speedie manner, hee
marched away.’</p>

<p>“He next proceeded to Kingston, where he devised
the means of crossing the river, though the bridge
was destroyed; and on the 7th of February he entered
London. His unhappy story is no farther connected
with that of London Bridge; and it will
therefore be sufficient to observe that he was executed
on the 11th of April, on Tower-hill, his quarters
being set up in several places, and his head on the
gibbet at Hay-hill, near Hyde Park; whence, however,
it was soon after stolen and carried away. In
addition to Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ let me observe that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
have also quoted from Holinshed’s ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ volume
iii., page 1097.</p>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>“Although, as I have fully shewn you, London
Bridge was, in general, most intimately connected
with the principal executions of the times, yet I do
not read that it was rendered remarkable, in the days
of Queen Mary, by being made the scene of any of
the numerous Protestant martyrdoms, which have
eternally blotted her short, but sanguinary reign.
There is, however, in Fox, a short anecdote connected
with our present subject, which I quote the more readily,
as it also bears a reference to the Church of
St. Magnus. Upon the death of Pope Julius III.,
in 1555, Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester and
Lord Chancellor, wrote to Bonner, Bishop of London,
to command him, in Queen Mary’s name, to order
those prayers to be used throughout his diocese,
which the Roman Church has appointed during a vacancy
in the Papal See. ‘Vpon this commandment,’&mdash;says
John Fox, in his immortal ‘<cite>Acts and Monuments
of Martyrs</cite>;’ London, 1610, volume iii., page 1417, column
2,&mdash;‘on Wednesday in Easter weeke,’&mdash;which,
in 1555, was the 17th of April,&mdash;‘there were hearses
set vp, and diriges sung for the said Julius, in diuers
places. At which time it chanced a woman to come
into Saint Magnus Church, at the Bridge-foot in
London, and there seeing an hearse and other preparation,
asked what it meant: and other that stood
by, said that it was for the Pope, and that she must
pray for him. ‘Nay,’ quoth she, ‘that I will not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
for he needeth not my prayer: and seeing he could
forgiue vs all our sins, I am sure he is cleane himselfe:
therefore I neede not to pray for him.’ She was heard
speake these words of certaine that stood by: which
by and by carried her vnto the cage at London
Bridge, and bade her coole her selfe there.’ In some of
the editions of Fox there is an engraving representing
this circumstance, which shews that the Stocks and
Cage stood by one of the archways on the Bridge,
and in one of the vacant spaces which looked on to
the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/355.jpg" width="386" height="450" alt="" title="Cage and Stocks on London Bridge." />
</div>

<p class="pc">I will but add, that Cages and Stocks were ordered
to be set up in every Ward of the City by Sir William
Capell, Draper, and Lord Mayor, in 1503.</p>
</div>

<p>“I cannot illustrate the year 1556 farther than by
an extract from the Account-Rolls of the Bridge-Keepers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
taken from the printed document already
mentioned; and the general particulars are as follow.
‘1556. Andrew Woodcock and William Maynard,
Bridge-Masters, received for this year’s fee, each,

<p>“The next view which we find representing London
Bridge, is supposed to have been taken about this
time, or at least <em>before</em> the year 1561, since it shews
the Cathedral of St. Paul surmounted by its famous
spire, which was then destroyed. The picture, itself,
is a prospect of London, taken from St. Catherine’s,
below the Tower, over the gate of which are two
turrets, since gone, and behind the Tower is a view of
Grace Dieu Abbey in the Minories, with the spires
and tops of several other Churches and buildings.
Mr. Gough, in his ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 748, esteems this to be the oldest view of
London extant; and states that it was a painting in
the possession of Mr. John Grove, of Richmond, who
had it engraven in Nov. 1754, by J. Wood, and dedicated
to the Right Honourable Philip, Lord Hardwicke,
Lord Chancellor, &amp;c. This view consists
of a whole-sheet folio plate, executed in the line-manner;
the Bridge is shewn in the distance, having
fifteen arches only, with three separate piles of buildings
and towers above: and in the front are several
ancient vessels and boats. Though Mr. Gough states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
that the plate has been mislaid, impressions from it
are by no means exceedingly rare, excepting when
they are in fine preservation, as to colour and margin;
and, it should be remarked, that there is also a quarto
copy of it in the second number of a singular, but
unfinished work, published by Messrs. Boydell and
Co. in 1818, entitled ‘<cite>London before the Great Fire</cite>.’
This view of London Bridge is, however, much too
distant for <em>our</em> purpose; even if its authority were
less apocryphal, than it is generally supposed to be.</p>

<p>“The year 1564 was remarkable, inasmuch as it
concerned London Bridge, for a severe frost upon the
Thames, which began on Thursday, December the 21st,
and of which Stow, in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 658, and
Holinshed in his ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ volume iii., page 1208,
give you some particulars. It is there stated, that the
frost continued to such an extremity, that on New-Year’s
Eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> ‘people went ouer and alongst the
Thames on the ise from London Bridge to Westminster.
Some plaied at the football as boldlie there,
as if it had beene on the drie land: diuerse of the
Court being then at Westminster, shot dailie at
prickes set vpon the Thames; and the people, both
men and women, went on the Thames in greater
numbers, than in anie street of the Citie of London.
On the third daie of January at night, it began to
thaw, and on the fift there was no ise to be seene
betweene London Bridge and Lambeth, which sudden
thaw caused great floods and high waters, that bare
downe bridges and houses, and drowned manie people
in England: especiallie in Yorkshire, Owes Bridge
was borne awaie with others.’</p>

<div>
<p>“Stow relates in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 64,
that in April, 1577, the Tower which stood at the
Northern end of the Draw-Bridge on London Bridge,
was become so decayed as to require taking down and
removing. A new building was consequently then commenced,
and the heads of the traitors which had formerly
stood upon it were re-erected on the Tower over
the Gate at the Bridge foot, Southwark; which was
subsequently known by the name of <span class="smcap">Traitors’ Gate</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/358.jpg" width="550" height="502" alt="" title="Traitors’ Gate." />
</div>
</div>

<p>“Whilst I am speaking to you of the removal of
these heads to the South end of London Bridge,&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
it comes a little out of the order of time,&mdash;I
must not forget to notice the increase of their number,
by those of several persons who were executed
for not acknowledging King Henry VIII. as Supreme
Head of the Church of England. The Act, by which
he was so constituted, was passed in the 27th year of
his reign,&mdash;1535,&mdash;and it ordained that all who refused
to take the Oath of the King’s Ecclesiastical
Supremacy, and renounce that of the Pope, whether
Clergyman or layman, should be considered as guilty
of High Treason. The first who suffered under this
Act were several of the Carthusian Monks of the
Charter-house,&mdash;preceded by their Prior, John Houghton,
on Tuesday, May the 4th,&mdash;whose heads were
then set up on the Bridge: but two of the most eminent
and remarkable instances, were those of Bishop
Fisher, and Sir Thomas More, to which I shall request
your attention whilst I give you a few particulars.</p>

<p>“John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, was executed
on St. Alban’s day, Tuesday, the 22nd of June, 1535,
about ten in the morning; and his head was to have
been erected upon Traitors’ Gate the same night, but
that it was delayed to be exhibited to Queen Anne
Boleyn. We gather these particulars from that
most curious little duodecimo, written by Hall, but
attributed to Dr. Thomas Baily, entitled ‘<cite>The Life
and Death of that renowned John Fisher, Bishop of
Rochester</cite>,’ London, 1655; in which also, at page 211,
there is the following interesting passage concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
London Bridge. ‘The next day after his burying,
the head, being parboyled, was pricked upon a pole,
and set on high upon London Bridge, among the rest
of the holy Carthusians’ heads that suffered death
lately before him. And here I cannot omit to declare
unto you the miraculous sight of this head, which,
after it had stood up the space of fourteen dayes upon
the Bridge, could not be perceived to wast nor consume:
neither for the weather, which then was very
hot, neither for the parboyling in hot water, but grew
daily fresher and fresher, so that in his life-time he
never looked so well; for his cheeks being beautified
with a comely red, the face looked as though it had
beholden the people passing by, and would have
spoken to them, which many took for a miracle, that
Almighty God was pleased to shew above the course
of Nature, in this preserving the fresh and lively
colour in his face, surpassing the colour he had being
alive, whereby was noted to the world the innocence
and holinesse of this blessed father, that thus innocently
was content to lose his head in defence of his
Mother, the Holy Catholique Church of Christ.
Wherefore the people coming daily to see this strange
sight, the passage over the Bridge was so stopped
with their going and coming, that almost neither cart
nor horse could passe: and, therefore, at the end of
fourteen daies, the executioner was commanded to
throw downe the head, in the night time, into the
River of Thames, and, in the place thereof, was set
the head of the most blessed and constant martyr,
Sir Thomas More, his companion, and fellow in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
his troubles, who suffered his passion’&mdash;on Tuesday,&mdash;‘the
6th of July next following,’ about nine o’clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>“The circumstances attendant upon the relique of
this most eminent man, were but little less singular than
the preceding; and Thomas More, his great-grandson,
in his very interesting Life of him, printed at London,
in octavo, 1726, pages 276, 277, says, ‘his head was
putt vpon London Bridge, where as trayters’ heads are
sett vpon poles:&mdash;and hauing remained some moneths
there, being to be cast into the Thames, because roome
should be made for diuerse others, who, in plentiful
sorte, suffered martyrdome for the same Supremacie,
shortly after it was bought by his daughter Margarett,
least,&mdash;as she stoutly affirmed before the Councell,
being called before them for the same matter&mdash;it should
be foode for fishes; which she buried where she
thought fittest. It was very well to be knowen, as
well by the liuelie fauour of him, which was not all
this while in anie thing almost diminished; as also
by reason of one tooth which he wanted whilst he
liued: herein it was to be admired, that the hayres of
his head being almost gray, before his martyrdome,
they seemed now, as it were, readish or yellow.’ The
pious daughter of this most celebrated Chancellor, is
said to have preserved this relique in a leaden case,
and to have ordered its interment, with her own body,
in the Roper vault, under a chapel adjoining St.
Dunstan’s, Canterbury, where it was seen in the year
1715; and again very recently.</p>

<div>
<p>“About the time of removing the black and decaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
fragments of these heads, there seem to have
been several other alterations and improvements effected
upon London Bridge; for Stow tells us that, to
replace the Tower which was taken down, ‘a new
foundation was drawn, and Sir John Langley, the
Lord Mayor, laid the first stone of another building,
in presence of the Sheriffs, and Bridge Masters, on
Wednesday, the 28th of August, 1577. In September,
1579, the Tower was finished, being a beautiful and
chargeable piece of work, and having all its fabric
above the Bridge formed of timber.’ This erection,
then, formed a second <span class="smcap">Southwark Gate and Tower</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/362.jpg" width="512" height="525" alt="" title="Southwark Gate and Tower." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc">The structure consisted of four circular turrets, connected
by curtains, and surmounted by battlements,
containing a great number of transom casements;
within which, having their roofs and chimneys rising
above the Tower, were several small habitations,
whilst beneath, was a broad covered passage; the
building itself projecting considerably over each side
of the Bridge, the width of the carriage-way, at this
part, being about 40 feet. Perhaps, however, the most
splendid and curious building which adorned London
Bridge at this time, was the famous <span class="smcap">Nonesuch House</span>;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/363.jpg" width="525" height="521" alt="" title="Nonesuch House." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc">so called, because it was constructed in Holland, entirely
of wood, and, being brought over in pieces,
was erected in this place with wooden pegs only, not
a single nail being used in the whole fabric. It stood
at some distance beyond the edifice which I last described
to you, nearer the City, at the Northern
entrance of the Drawbridge; and its situation is even
yet pointed out to you, by the 7th and 8th Arches of
London Bridge, from the Southwark end, being still
called the Draw Lock, and the Nonesuch Lock. On
the London side of the Bridge, the Nonesuch House
was partly joined to numerous small wooden dwellings,
of about 27 feet in depth, which hung over the parapet
on each side, leaving, however, a clear space of
20 feet in the centre; though, over all these, its carved
gables, cupolas, and gilded vanes, majestically towered.
Two Sun-dials, declining East and West, also crowned
the top on the South side; on the former of which
was painted the old and appropriate admonition of
‘<em>Time and Tide stay for no man</em>;’ though these ornaments
do not appear to have been erected until the
year 1681, in the Mayoralty of Sir Patience Ward.
This we learn from Edward Hatton’s ‘<cite>New View of
London</cite>,’ volume ii., page 791.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“Like most of those other buildings, this celebrated
edifice also overhung the East and West sides of the
Bridge; and there presented to the Thames two fronts,
of scarcely less magnificence than it exhibited to
Southwark and the City; the columns, windows, and
carving, being similarly splendid; and, thus, equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
curious and interesting, was the <span class="smcap">Nonesuch House
on London Bridge, seen from the water</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/365.jpg" width="396" height="600" alt="" title="Nonesuch House
on London Bridge, seen from the water." />
</div>

<p class="pc">Its Southern front only, however, stood perfectly unconnected
with other erections, that being entirely
free for about fifty feet before it, and presenting the
appearance of a large building projecting beyond the
Bridge on either side; having a square tower at each
extremity, crowned by short domes, or Kremlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
spires, whilst an antiquely-carved gable arose in each
centre. The whole of the front, too, was ornamented
with a profusion of transom casement windows, with
carved wooden galleries before them; and richly
sculptured wooden panels and gilded columns were
to be found in every part of it. In the centre was
an arch, of the width of the Drawbridge, leading over
the Bridge; and above it, on the South side, were
carved the Arms of St. George, of the City of London,
and those of Elizabeth, France and England quarterly,
supported by the Lion and Dragon; from which circumstance,
only, can we estimate the time when the
Nonesuch House was erected.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Allow me, however, to observe at this place,” said
I, as Mr. Postern pronounced these last words, “that
we have another, and a very curious piece of evidence
too, for believing that the Nonesuch House on London
Bridge was placed there about this very period: inasmuch
as that excellent and indefatigable antiquary,
Mr. Sharp, of the most ancient City of Coventry, has
discovered, in the manuscript accounts of that place,
a memorandum which certainly has reference to this
very building; and which, as he has favoured me with
a copy, I shall repeat to you.&mdash;‘1585. Paid to Durram,
the paynter, to bye Coulors to paynt the <em>Vawte</em> at
the Maior’s palace, in parte of payment of xxx <em>s.</em>, to
ley the vawte in oyle Colers substancially, the greate
posts in jasper Collur, as <em>the newe house on London
Bridge ys</em>: all the rayles in stone Coulo<sup>r</sup>, the smale

perfect greene Coullo<sup>r</sup> xiij.<em>s.</em> iiij.<em>d.</em>’&mdash;‘The <em>Vawte</em>,’&mdash;he
adds,&mdash;‘was a balcony, or colonnade, in front of the
Mayor’s Parlour, supported by large pillars, and
having a ballustrade of smaller pillars round the flat-leaded
roof of it.’ This, Mr. Barnaby, it must be
confessed, is very like the features of the Nonesuch
House on London Bridge: and it is not at all improbable
but what we have here almost the very year of
its erection.”</p>

<p>“You are right, worthy Mr. Barbican, you are
right,” said the old Historian of the Bridge; “and I
would to Heaven, that no Antiquarian discussion
ever demanded a heavier concession. But now let us
return for a while from the buildings on London
Bridge, to the scattered events which illustrate its
history; for I purpose again speaking of its appearance
when we arrive at the close of this century, and of
then mentioning all the ancient prospects of it, whence
I have drawn my descriptions of its edifices.</p>

<p>“It was in 1582 that the idea was first formed of
erecting Water-works against the Arches of London
Bridge; and of adapting the violence of the torrent,
as it rushed through its narrow locks, to some purpose
of general utility. As a good account of these original
works is given in Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 696,
and in Holinshed’s ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>,’ volume iii., page 1348,
I shall give you the very words, as conveying the
best illustration of them. ‘This year,’&mdash;says Abraham
Fleming, Holinshed’s continuator,&mdash;‘Peter Moris,
a Dutchman, but a Free-Denizen, having made an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
engine for that purpose, conueied Thames water in
pipes of lead ouer the steeple of St. Magnus Church,
at the North end of London Bridge, and so into
diuerse men’s houses in Thames Street, New Fish
Street, and Grasse-street, vp vnto the North-west
corner of Leadenhall,&mdash;the highest ground of the
Citie of London,&mdash;where the waste of the first maine
pipe ran first this yeare, one thousand five hundred
eightie and two, on Christmasse eeuen; which maine
pipe, being since at the charges of the Citie brought vp
into a standard there made for that purpose, and diuided
there into foure severall spouts, ranne foure
waies, plentifullie seruing to the vse of the inhabitants
neere adioining, that will fetch the same into
their houses, and also clensed the chanels of the streets,
North towards Bishopsgate, East towards Aldgate,
South towards the Bridge, and West towards the
Stocks Market. No doubt a great commoditie to that
part of the Citie, and would be farre greater, if the
said water were mainteined to run continuallie, or at
the least at euerie tide some reasonable quantitie, as at
the first it did; but since is much aslaked, thorough
whose default I know not, sith the engine is sufficient
to conueie water plentifullie: which, being well considered
by Bernard Randolph, Esquier, Common Sergeant
of the Citie of London, he, being aliue, gaue and
deliuered to the Company of Fishmongers, in London,
a round sum to be imploied towards conducting the
Thames water, for the good seruice of the Commonwealth,
in conuenient order.’ It was probably the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
success of this engine which occasioned another of
four pumps, worked by horses, to be erected at
Broken-Wharf, near Queenhithe; invented, as Stow
observes in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 769, by Bevis Bulmar,
‘a most ingenious gentleman.’ It was at first intended
to convey the Thames water, by leaden pipes, to the
whole Western part of London; but after working it
for a short time, it was laid aside, on account of its
great charge both to the tenants and the proprietors.</p>

<p>“After this I meet with but little to notice in our
Bridge Annals, for several years, excepting, that in
1583, Sir Edward Osborne, being then Lord Mayor,
is said to have introduced the custom of drinking to
the new Sheriffs, although there is a ludicrous instance
of such a ceremony in 1487; and that Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>’
inform us, at page 698, that on the conclusion of the
Irish rebellion, James, Earl of Desmond, a principal
leader, ‘secretly wandering without any succour,
being taken in his cabine by one of the Irish, his
head was cut off and sent into England, where the
same,&mdash;as the head of an arch-rebell,&mdash;was set on
London-Bridge on the thirteene of December.’</p>

<p>“It was on December the 4th, 1586, that the Commissioners
appointed to try the unfortunate Mary,
Queen of Scots, issued their sentence against her
from Richmond; which, on the 6th, was openly read in
London, by William Sebright, the Town-Clerk. This
proclamation, as Stow relates in his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page
741, was made with the Serjeants at Arms, and by
sound of trumpets, about ten o’clock in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
at four places in the City; namely, at the end of
Chancery lane; at the Cross in Cheapside; at the
corner of Leadenhall; and also at St. Magnus,
London Bridge. It was witnessed by several of the
Nobility; the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, in their
scarlet dresses; the City Officers; the principal part
of the gentry of London, and the most eminent
Citizens habited in velvet with gold chains; all
mounted on horseback. The tidings which were thus
made known, were received by the people with every
kind of rejoicing; ‘as manifestly appeared,’&mdash;says
Stow,&mdash;‘by ringing of bells, making of bonfires, and
singing of psalmes in euery of the streetes and lanes
of the Citie.’</p>

<p>“I do not find, in the preparations for defending
London against the Spaniards, in 1588, any orders
concerning the guarding of the Bridge; though in
the scheme for marshalling the City, then drawn up
by Edmund York, and printed in volume ii. of Stow’s
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ page 569, it is observed that the Bridge is
to be one of the places watched as a gate of London.
This, however, was not the first time that the Citizens
had been under military discipline, for Stow relates,
in the same volume, page 567, that in September,
1586, when so much danger was anticipated from the
conspiracies of the Papists, a series of orders was
drawn up for their instruction. In these regulations
it was stated, that the gates should be shut every
night, and the Portcullises put in order; and that one
of the stations of the watch by the water-side, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
be by the engine which supplied the City with water,
which was at the North-West corner of London Bridge,
and almost adjoining to the present site of Fishmongers’
Hall. Both these anticipated dangers, however,
passed away without any other effect upon London,
than that of evincing the courage of the Citizens; and,
after the notable defeat of the Armada, eleven of the
captured standards were hung upon London-Bridge,
towards Southwark, on Monday, September the 9th,
the day of the Fair in that place, to the great rejoicing
of all who saw them.</p>

<p>“Besides the before-mentioned engines for supplying
the City with water, there were, however, also
Corn Mills erected near London Bridge, at a very
early period in the sixteenth century: for Stow, in
volume i. of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ page 42, observes that
they were built on the Thames, about the year 1508.
These were, however, not the most ancient machines
of that nature erected about this place; for in the
year 1197, in an exchange of the Manor of Lambethe
for the Manor of Darent, made between Hubert
Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Monks of
Rochester, there is a notice of a Mill which ‘the
aforesaid Monks have without Southwark on the
Thames, towards the East, against the Tower of London.’
You may see the original instrument in the
third volume of Dugdale’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monasticon Anglicanum</cite>,’
London, ‘In the Savoy,’ 1673, folio, page 4. It was
therefore, upon these precedents, for the better supply
of the City, in consequence of the dearth and scarcity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of corn which had extended for several miles round
London, and also on account of the difficulty of
grinding meal for the poor, that in March 1588, the
Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, petitioned Queen
Elizabeth that they might erect four Corn Mills
under two roofs on the Thames, near the Bridge, in
parts where they could not occasion any injury. On
the 1st of April, therefore, a commission was addressed
from the Court, at Greenwich, to Mr. Rokesby,
Master of St. Katherine’s, Mr. Fanshaw, Master of
the Requests, and Mr. Peter Osborn, Remembrancer
of the Exchequer, to call before them such persons
as should be appointed by the City to manage their
cause; some of the principal Officers of the Navy,
and certain Masters of the Trinity-House, to consult
with them whether the erection of such Mills would
be beneficial, or inconvenient; and to consider in what
places they should be set up, in order that the Queen
might be moved to grant the City’s petition. After
this consultation, a certificate, dated May the 16th,
was returned by all the parties summoned, and the
eight Masters and Overseers of the River, and others
of the Assistants of the Company of Watermen, that
the erecting of such Mills could not in any way be
hurtful to the Thames. But as Stow has left on
record the Trinity-House Certificate, I shall give it
you in the original form and words.</p>

<p>“‘Whereas it hath pleased the Lords of Her Majesty’s
most Honourable Privy Council to direct their
letter to the Worshipful Mr. Rookesby, Master of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
St. Katherine’s, Mr. Fanshaw, Mr. Osborn, Commissioners
for the building of certain Mills on the South
side of Thames upon the starlings above the Bridge:
and the Commissioners above-named, have sent for us,
the Master and Assistants of the Trinity-House of
Deptford-Strand in Kent, that we should make the
survey, whether the erecting of those Mills might be
prejudicial, or hurtful, to the said River; We whose
names are hereunder written, with others, have taken
a view of the said place, and do find, as far as we can
judge and foresee, it will not be hurtful, nor prejudicial,
to the said River in any way. April 4th, 1588.</p>

<p>“In Stow’s same work and volume, page 62, he
states, that as soon as these Mills were set up, complaint
was made to the Court, which produced the
foregoing enquiry; and that it was then ordered, that
the water should have free course through the arches
of the Bridge, and that the parts of the Mills which
stood nearest to the stone-work of the edifice, should
still be twelve feet distant from any part of it. The
intent of these Mills was to provide a remedy for
times of dearth, when the common people paid from
4<em>d.</em> to 6<em>d.</em> the bushel for grinding their corn, and
often, for a considerable time, could not get it ground
at all; to supply which they were constrained to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
meal at the meal-sellers’ own prices, which they increased
at their pleasure.</p>

<p>“We have no very perfect idea left us of the appearance
of either the Mills, or the ancient Waterworks
erected against London Bridge. Gough, in
his ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ volume i., page 735, states
on the authority of Bagford, that in the Pepysian
Library, at Cambridge, there is ‘a draught of
London Bridge, expressing the Mill at the end;&mdash;as
also a very old drawing of this Bridge on Fire, on
vellum.’”</p>

<div>
<p>“Yes, Master Postern,” said I, “he does so; and
that same ‘very old drawing,’ is nothing less than a
most fair and interesting view of the Western side, as
it appeared about the time of Elizabeth, or James I.,
delicately drawn with a pen, slightly shaded, coloured,
and gilded, but all faded by time, and nearly worn
out by having been folded in two, from the continual
friction of the surfaces. It measures about 24&frac14; inches,
by 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches; and is now contained in the portfolio
marked ‘<cite>London and Westminster</cite>, 1. 246, 247. C.’
As the Bridge is represented with the Northern end
in a perfectly entire state, it must have been drawn
anterior to the great conflagration which destroyed it
in 1632-33; though it was probably to commemorate
that event, that some rude and barbarous hand has
disfigured it with those numerous streaks of red,
which Bagford and Gough supposed to represent
flames. From the minute and careful manner in which
it is drawn, it may certainly be esteemed as peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
authentic; and, therefore, I proceed to notice to you,
that it, very probably, contains a representation of the
four Mills, which you have already mentioned as
being set up near this place. At the Southern end,
below the Traitors’ Gate, is a kind of long shed, formed
of shingles, or thin boards, erected on three of the sterlings,
and covering, as the Citizens proposed, four water
wheels, which edifice is, doubtless, intended to represent
the <span class="smcap">Ancient Corn Mills at London Bridge</span>.</p>

</div>

<div>
<p>“Now, Mr. Barnaby, as this building stands out so
far from the Bridge itself as to leave a considerable
space between them, though enclosed on all sides, a
sort of water-square open at the top, it appears to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
an evident proof that it represents those very Mills.
In the roof of the building are three sets of windows;
and an open stage, or floor, appears a short distance
below it. At the North end, also, of this most interesting
prospect, against the first sterling, is a high
square building, like a tower, having a low wooden
gallery in front of it; and a single water-wheel turning
beneath it; which are, most probably, intended for
the <span class="smcap">Waterworks and Tower at London Bridge</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>
<p>“With regard to the other principal features of the
Pepysian view, I shall remark to you only, that the
Western side of the Nonesuch House is delineated in
the richest and most delicate manner, all its carvings
and columns being minutely drawn and touched with
gold; whilst a whole grove of heads and quarters
raised upon staves stands upon the top of the Traitors’
Gate beyond it; and so much then for a brief description
of this ancient prospect of London Bridge.”</p>

<p>“I am much your debtor, most worthy Master
Geoffrey,” said Mr. Postern, as I concluded, “I, truly,
am greatly your debtor, for these curious notices of
a view, at once so rare, so interesting, and so antique:
and, touching the Water-house, or Tower, to which you
have alluded, although we have not any certain information
of the time when it was erected, yet from the
circumstance of its appearing with a name in John
Norden’s very scarce view of London Bridge, which
I shall presently mention, it may be supposed to have
been set up in the time of Elizabeth, and was, perhaps,
as old as the Water-works themselves. In the first
edition of Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ by Strype, London, 1720,
volume i., book ii., page 174, there is a passage relating
to the Water-house, which does not appear
either in the original edition of 1598, nor in the last
ancient one of 1633; and therefore may be very
justly supposed to refer to the wooden building erected
<em>after</em> the Great Fire; when it will most properly be
noticed.</p>

<p>“I must here again refer to the Account-rolls of
the Bridge Keepers, for the memoranda of some past
years’ revenues and expenditure, to inform you that in
the year 1562 the rental was &pound;1071. 6<em>s.</em> The salaries,
and allowance for horsekeeping, to William Draper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
and Robert Essington, the Wardens, were the same
as those paid in 1556; but the liveries were increased
to &pound;3. 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> each. The whole amount for the year
being &pound;64. In 1565,&mdash;says the same authority,&mdash;the
allowance to each Bridge-Master for fees, livery, &amp;c.
was &pound;33.: and the rental of the estates amounted
to &pound;1168. 8<em>s.</em> 5&frac12;<em>d.</em>: while in 1590, the Bridge rental
was &pound;1369. 7<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>; and Robert Aske and James
Conneld, the Wardens, paid the two Bridge-Masters
for their Year’s fee, &pound;50. each, with &pound;3. each for
their horses and liveries; making the whole charge
&pound;106.</p>

<p>“In the year 1591, a most singular instance of
drought occurred in the vicinity of our history, as
you may read in Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 765, where he
states, that on ‘Wednesday, the sixth of September,
the wind West-and-by-South, as it had beene for the
space of two days before, very boysterous, the
riuer of Thamis was so voyd of water, by forcing out
the fresh and keeping backe the sault, that men in
diuers places might goe 200 paces ouer, and then fling
a stone to the land. A Collier, on a mare, rode from
the North side to the South, and backe againe, on
either side of London Bridge, but not without danger
of drowning both wayes.’</p>

<p>“The year 1594 was particularly remarkable for a
dearth of corn, occasioned, as Stow tells us, it was
supposed,&mdash;see his ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 769,&mdash;by the English
Merchants having exported it too largely. The
summer had been extremely wet; for not only much
rain fell in May; but, in the following two months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
it commonly rained every day, or night, until the
25th of July, the Feast of St. James, and two days
after, without intermission. Notwithstanding these
floods a fair harvest followed in August, but the price
of grain rose to 5<em>s.</em> for a bushel of Rye, whilst Wheat
was sold from 6<em>s.</em> to 8<em>s.</em> the bushel, and increased even
still higher. In consequence of this, Sir John Spencer,
the Lord Mayor, procured it to be ordered, that the
several Companies of the City should presently provide
themselves with certain proportions of wheat and
rye, to be laid up in the public granaries at the
Bridge House. In December, however, the greatest
part of their stores was yet wanting, and the Lord
Mayor, therefore, issued a new order on the 13th of
that month, directing that the whole quantity should
be laid up in the Bridge-House before the 8th of the
ensuing January; since corn was then being imported
into England. At this period, Elizabeth was, most
probably, preparing those twenty-six vessels, which she
despatched, the following year, to Spanish America,
under Sir John Hawkins; since, in his capacity of
Treasurer of the Navy, he demanded of the Lord
Mayor the Bridge-House, granaries, ovens, &amp;c. for
the use of the Queen’s Navy, and baking biscuits for
the fleet. Cecil, Lord Burleigh, who was then Lord
Treasurer, being a great patron and protector of the
City; to him the Lord Mayor addressed a remonstrance
against Sir John Hawkins, stating all the foregoing
circumstances, that the City would be deprived
of its provision, if he lent the granaries; that the
Companies would neglect to lay up the corn they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
were enjoined to do, and that grain must either be
bought from the Badgers, or Meal-sellers, or else the
Merchants be discouraged from importing any more.
He added also, that the ovens in the Bridge-House
were required for baking bread for the City poor, at
reduced rates; and he concluded by representing that
the Queen had not only granaries about Tower Hill,
Whitehall, and Westminster, but that Winchester
House was also in her possession, in which large quantities
of corn might be deposited. This honest and
spirited conduct of the Lord Mayor produced, on the
part of Admiral Hawkins, the reply ‘that he should
hear more to his further dislike,’ as well as some
letters from the Privy Council in censure of his proceedings.
Upon which he again addressed the Lord
Treasurer, entreated his favour and protection, and
petitioned that the granaries might still be employed
for the use of the City, lest the dearth of corn should
yet increase, or the poor of London should be distressed
for provision: adding that, as the City was
then unprovided, his Lordship would hold him excused
from resigning the Bridge House, and submitting
himself to his good pleasure. With these
answers, Hawkins was probably forced to be content,
as we meet with no farther correspondence upon this
subject.</p>

<p>“With these particulars, then, terminate our annals
of London Bridge for the sixteenth century; but
before we pass on to the opening of the following one,
let me mention to you the views of this edifice which
we possess, illustrative of the period we have now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
arrived at, and give you a general idea of its appearance,
whilst it yet remained in its greatest state of
splendour.</p>

<p>“One of the most ancient representations of London
Bridge is contained in that painting of the procession
of King Edward VI. from the Tower, to his
Coronation at Westminster, February the 19th, 1547;
the original of which was executed to decorate a part
of the Great Dining Room of Cowdray Hall, Sussex,
the seat of Viscount Montague, where it was destroyed
by fire in 1793. An engraving of this interesting
picture was, however, published by the Society
of Antiquaries in May, 1797; and the Bridge
is there represented at the left hand of the engraving,
containing four or five buildings erected on the side,
in the centre of which rises a spire, perhaps meant
for the Chapel of St. Thomas; and at the Southern
end appears the gate. This, however, is but an oblique
view, and by no means to be depended upon for
its accuracy; though, at the same time, the plate
contains numerous other interesting features of antiquity,
which render it invaluable to all the admirers
of London in the olden times. The next most ancient
prints of this edifice are those maps and plans of
London which include the Bridge; such as that contained
in the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civitates Orbis Terrarum</cite>,’ by George
Braun and Francis Hohenberg, volume i., Cologne,
1523, folio, signature A:&mdash;the famous map of Radulphus
Aggas, published about 1588; and some
others of less note, of which you have a tolerably
accurate account in Richard Gough’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span> ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’
volume i., pages 743-760. These plans,
however, although exceedingly interesting, are, from
their great extent, less pleasing than a view, as it
regards particulars; for the buildings are sometimes
so rudely and minutely sketched, as to convey no
perfect idea to the minds of such as desire to contemplate
old London in all its original quaintness and
antique beauty.</p>

<p>“But, perhaps, the rarest and most curious prospect
of London Bridge in the reign of Elizabeth, is that
engraven by John Norden, of which an impression
rests in Mrs. Sutherland’s sumptuously-illustrated
copy of Lord Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion,
in 31 volumes imperial folio, comprising 5800 prints
and original drawings. Norden, you will recollect,
was Surveyor to Henry, Prince of Wales, and died
about 1626; and his view of London Bridge was, most
probably, published two years before, for, though it is
without date, it bears the arms of, and is dedicated
to, Sir John Gore, Lord Mayor in 1624. The dedication
states, however, that Norden had ‘described it
in the time of Queene Elizabeth, but that the plate
had bene neare these 20 yeares imbezeled and detained
by a person till of late vnknowne.’ The view
of the Bridge is taken from the Eastern side, and the
edifice is represented horizontally, from South to
North; though it is singularly enough stated to be
from East to West: it measures 20&frac12; inches by 10<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>,
and is engraved in a border surmounted by the arms
and supporters of James I., having its name written
upon a scroll. At each end of the print is a naked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
boy flying; the one bearing a shield with the City
Arms, and the other those of the person to whom it is
dedicated. With respect to the Bridge itself, it is
filled with buildings, in which the Traitors’ Gate
with the heads, the Nonesuch House, and the Chapel
of St. Thomas, are particularly visible; whilst above
the houses, at the North end, is seen the top of ‘<em>The
Water Worke</em>.’ From the windows of several of the
houses, buckets are being let down by long ropes
into the water, which is seen rushing through the
arches with great impetuosity, although there is no
fall. On the right appears a boat overturned, its oars
floating about, one man drowning, and two others
being saved by another boat; whilst two or three
more vessels, &amp;c. are seen in different parts of the
picture. Along the lower part of the water are engraven
the words ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tame Isis Flvvius vulgo Temms</i>;’
and below the print are the Dedication, and ‘<em>The
description of London Bridge</em>,’ in letter-press in three
columns, surrounded by a border of metal flowers,
and signed John Norden. As this account is, of
course, very short, and is chiefly taken from Stow, it
gives us but little information; though, perhaps, the
concluding paragraphs may not be unworthy of your
attention.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>‘It were superfluous to relate vnto such as
well know, and duely do consider the forme and
beauty of this famous Bridge: but to intimate it to
the apprehension of strangers, I haue deliniated the
same to the eye, how it is adorned with sumptuous
buildings, and statelie and beautifull houses on either
side, inhabited by wealthy Citizens, and furnished
with all manner of trades, comparable in it selfe to a
little Citie, whose buildings are so artificially contriued,
and so firmely combined, as it seemeth more
than an ordinary streete, for it is as one continuall
vaute or roofe, except certaine voyde places, reserued
from buildings, for the retire of passengers from the
danger of carres, carts, and droues of cattell, vsually
passing that way. This description representeth vnto
the eye the true forme of this famous pyle, as neare
as arte&mdash;in this kinde of deliniation,&mdash;can be demonstrated:
the number and forme of euery arch, and all
the buildings; their true height, breadth, and distance
of euery particular, from the East towards the West:
as for the other side it like wise appeareth in my
prospectiue description of the Citie; the vaults,
sellers, and places in the bowels as it were of the
same Bridge,&mdash;which are many and admirable,&mdash;excepted,
which arte cannot discouer to the outward
view. The situation, arte, and workmanship, in and
about the Bridge, are affirmed by obseruing trauailers
in all respects to exceede all the Bridges of the world.
And, therefore, I thought it fit to represent it to the
view of the world, that it may know, that if one part
of this Citie be so famous, how much more the whole:
which, for state and Christian gouernment, may well
challenge place before any Citie in Christendome.
And therefore I present vnto you this simple modell
of one of the wonders of the world.’ So concludes
the descriptive eulogy of Master Norden. And now,
Sir, having mentioned to you the great rarity of this
print of London Bridge, and that if another impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of it were to appear, it would probably produce
the respectable price of ten, or fifteen guineas; I
must add that there has been an excellent fac-simile
of it published by Mr. William Scott, of Great May’s
Buildings, St. Martin’s Lane, for the more moderate
sum of 10<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, which no genuine lover of London,
or London Bridge, should hesitate to procure.</p>

<div>
<p>“The last view of this edifice which I shall at
present notice to you, is one copied by Thomas Wood,
Engraved by J. Pye, and dedicated to Brass Crosby,
Esq., Lord Mayor, the Aldermen, and Common
Council of the City of London; and it represents the
‘<em>South View of the said City and part of Southwarke,
as it appeared about the year 1599</em>.’ I am half inclined
to believe, however, that this prospect is made
up from Hollar’s View, published in 1657; as it is
certainly taken from the same point. The Bridge
rises obliquely on the right hand: at the South end of
it appears the Southwark Gate, and beyond it is placed
the rich tower which I have already described to
you; whilst a series of buildings, forming two distinct
groups, with spaces between them, finish the picture,
which has the old Church of St. Magnus for its
Northern boundary. Even at this period, probably,
some of the Arches of London Bridge had received
those names by which they were so long afterwards
known, though they were first inserted in Stow’s
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ by Richard Bloome, one of the last of his
Continuators before Strype; but his account of these
locks I shall speak of in the next century, and I will
now only observe that such were the features of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>

<p>“‘Thanks be praised!’ Master Barnaby,” said I, as
my indefatigable historian arrived at this period,
“‘thanks be praised!’ as the Countryman says in the
Play, ‘I thought we would never ha’ got hither, for
we’ve had a power of crosses upo’ the road.’ If you
do not make the better speed through the next two
centuries, mine honest friend, you will scarcely allow
me time to conclude your narrative by a brief account
of the New Bridge, and the grand ceremonial of its
foundation: here’s your health, however, and if contributing
to one’s repose, be a praiseworthy action,
why, truly, I’m much your debtor, good Mr. Postern.”</p>

<p>“Rest you merry, Sir,” replied he of the sack tankard;
“I see that you’re one of the humourists of Old
London; and, methinks, you ought to be somewhat
grateful to me for furnishing you with occasion to be
witty; but, to speak more seriously, I pray you to
recollect that I have conducted you through a period
of more than six hundred years, and that too in a history
of which the materials are to be sought for, and
extracted, from a vast multitude of very opposite
sources. And even when we have found them, you
know, my good Mr. Barbican, that they resemble those
grains of gold which the wandering Bohemians recover
from the sand; of little or no value till collected
into a mass, and even then surprising by their
insignificance. Surely, he is to be pitied, who becomes
the historian of a subject equally ancient, interesting,
hopeless, and unknown.”</p>

<p>“A very good reason,” answered I, “for not becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
one at all, Master Barnaby; Odzooks! do
men write your thick folios, only because they know
nothing of the matter? But you have no such excuse,
for you quote me a dozen authors to tell of one
event; and then there’s such ‘fending and proving’
about a handful of years, that where subjects are
lacking, ’fore George! you seem to me to create
them.”</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“Well, Sir, well,” resumed the mild old man,
“your wit becomes you; but as we may never meet
again, I would fain pour into your bosom all the little
knowledge which I possess upon this point; and so
we will pass on to the Chronicles of London Bridge
in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>“The inhuman cruelties which Queen Mary,
Bishop Bonner, and others of their faith, practised
upon the Protestants, may reasonably be supposed to
have so embittered their minds, as to have excited in
them no slight feelings of revenge, when, in their
turn, they came into power. Indeed, it is difficult to
imagine any other cause for the severities which they
practised, or for the laws which were enacted to
authorise them. The principal of these Statutes, you
may remember, were five: one in the 27th of Elizabeth,
1585, chapter ii., entitled ‘<cite>An Act against Jesuits,
Seminary Priests, and other such like disobedient
persons</cite>;’ and a second passed in her 35th year, 1593,
chapter ii., and called ‘<cite>An Act for restraining Popish
Recusants to some certain place of abode</cite>.’ Under King
James I., were introduced three others strengthening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and confirming the former, the first of which was
made in the 1st year of his reign, 1604, chapter iv.,
being ‘<cite>An Act for the due execution of the Statutes
against Jesuits, Seminary Priests, Recusants, &amp;c.</cite>’:
and in his third year, 1606, were passed two others,
see chapters iv. and v., namely, ‘<cite>An Act for the
better discovering and repressing of Popish Recusants</cite>;’
and ‘<cite>An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which grow
by Popish Recusants</cite>.’ History, Master Barbican,
blushes to record what cruelties were perpetrated
under the sanction of those laws; and I should have
omitted all notice of them, but that they are so interwoven
with several anecdotes of London Bridge.
My authority is a work, entitled ‘<cite>The Catholic Book
of Martyrs, or a true British Martyrology commencing
with the Reformation</cite>;’ by the Right Rev. Richard
Challoner, Bishop of Debora; of which the new edition
of 1825 is a singularly curious book. He states
from Stow, in volume ii., page 9, that in 1578,
February 3rd, John Nelson, a Priest, was executed
at Tyburn, for denying the Queen’s supremacy, and
that his head was erected on London Bridge; whilst,
on page 74, is a similar relation of another Priest
named James Fenn; but I proceed to notice a much
more remarkable instance. In the year 1605, Father
Henry Garnet, the Principal of the English Jesuits,
was taken up and imprisoned in the Tower, for being
a party concerned in the famous Gunpowder Plot:
after many examinations, he acknowledged that
Father Greenway, a Jesuit, had communicated it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
him under the seal of confession from Catesby, the
Chief of the conspirators. Both the Priests were
struck with horror at the design, and vainly endeavoured
to prevent its execution. Greenway fled
beyond the seas, but Father Garnet was taken, condemned,
and executed in St. Paul’s Church Yard, on
the 3rd of May, the Anniversary of the Invention,
or Finding of the Holy Cross by the Empress Helena,
the Mother of Constantine. ‘His head,’ says Bishop
Challoner, in his ‘<cite>Catholic Book of Martyrs</cite>,’ volume
iii., page ii., ‘was fixed on London Bridge, and
it was much remarked, that his countenance, which
was always venerable, retained, for above twenty days,
the same lively colour which it had during life, which
drew all London to the spectacle, and was interpreted
as a testimony of his innocence; as was also an image
of him wonderfully formed on an ear of straw, on
which a drop of his blood had fallen.’ Dr. Challoner
gives his authorities for this narrative at its commencement.</p>

<p>“But to pass from these unhappy subjects to the
story of London Bridge, and the River Thames, let
me next observe that the year 1608 was remarkable
for a great frost near this edifice, of which we have
a very curious account in Edmond Howe’s ‘<cite>Continuation
of the Abridgement of Stow’s English Chronicle</cite>,’
London, 1611, duodecimo, page 481; from which take
the following extract. ‘The 8th of December began a
hard frost, and continued vntill the 15th of the same,
and then thawed: and the 22nd of December it began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
againe to freeze violently, so as diuers persons went
halfe way ouer the Thames vpon the ice: and the
30th of December, at euery ebbe, many people went
quite ouer the Thames in diuers places, and so continued
from that day vntill the third of January: the
people passed daily betweene London and the Bankside
at euery halfe ebbe, for the floud remoued the ice
and forced the people daily to tread new paths, except
onely betweene Lambeth and the ferry at Westminster,
the which, by incessant treading, became
very firm and free passage, vntill the great thaw: and
from Sunday, the tenth of January, vntill the fifteenth
of the same, the frost grew so extreme, as the ice became
firme, and remoued not, and then all sorts of men,
women, and children, went boldly upon the ice in
most parts; some shot at prickes, others bowled and
danced, with other variable pastimes; by reason of
which concourse of people, there were many that set
vp boothes and standings vpon the ice, as fruit-sellers,
victuallers, that sold beere and wine, shoomakers, and
a barber’s tent, &amp;c.’ He adds, that all these had
fires; that the frost killed all the artichokes in the
gardens about London; and that the ice lasted until
the afternoon of the 2nd of February, when ‘it was
quite dissolued and clean gon.’ There is a very rare
tract, containing an account of this frost, mentioned
by Gough in his ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 731, which has a wood-cut representation of it,
with London Bridge in the distance: and is entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
‘<cite>Cold doings in London, except it be at the
Lottery: with newes out of the Country. A familier
talk, between a Countryman and a Citizen, touching
this terrible Frost, and the Great Lottery, and the
effect of them.</cite>’ London, 1608, quarto. I may observe
that the Lottery was then drawn at St. Paul’s,
the prizes were all of plate, the highest being &pound;150,
and the price of each ticket was one shilling only. The
same year of 1608 was also memorable for two tides
flowing at London Bridge, on Sunday, the 19th of
February. Edmond Howes records it in his Continuation
of Stow’s ‘<cite>Annals</cite>,’ page 893, and states
that ‘when it should haue beene dead low water at
London Bridge, quite contrary to course it was then
high water; and, presently, it ebbed almost halfe an
houre, the quantitie of a foote, and then sodainly it
flowed againe almost two foote higher than it did
before, and then ebbed againe vntill it came neere the
right course, so as the next floud began, in a manner,
as it should, and kept his due course in all respects
as if there had beene no shifting, nor alteration of
tydes. All this happened before twelue of the clocke
in the forenoone, the weather being indifferent calme;
and the sixt of February, the next yeere following,
the Thames againe shifted tydes very strangely.’</p>

<p>“We know not, Mr. Barbican, at what exact period
London Bridge was first occupied by shops, but
in the Survey of Bridge-lands which I have already
repeated to you, it appears very probable that some
of the shops in the Bridge Street were actually
erected on the Bridge. Houses with distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
signs, however, must have been built upon this edifice
at a very early period; for the first notice of one,
which I can now recollect, is in the fire which brake
out at the Pannier, at the North end of the Bridge
in 1504; whilst the next is not older than 1619, and
occurs in a letter written October the 6th, by George
Herbert, the pious author of the ‘<cite>Temple</cite>,’ and
printed at the end of Izaak Walton’s ‘<cite>Lives</cite>,’ fourth
edition, London, 1675, 8vo., page 340. ‘I pray,
Sir, therefore,’&mdash;says this epistle,&mdash;‘cause this inclosed
to be carried to his brother’s house,’&mdash;Sir Francis
Nethersole,&mdash;‘of his own name, as I think, at the
sign of the Pedlar and his Pack on London Bridge,
for there he assigns me.’ Norden, as I have already
shewn you, says that this place was ‘furnished with
all manner of trades;’ and as this is rather a curious,
though an unexplored portion of Bridge story, I shall
at once lay before you all the information which I have
collected upon it, under the present period of time,
since it is infinitely too small to be divided into different
years. The principal ancient residences of the London
Booksellers were, St. Paul’s Church Yard, Little
Britain, Paternoster Row, and London Bridge; and
of books published at the latter place let me first
exhibit to you some titles, taken from that vast collection,
which John Bagford made for a General
History of Printing, preserved with the Harleian
Manuscripts in the British Museum. The ensuing
are from No. 5921, pages 5&#8201;b, 6&#8201;a, 7&#8201;a, and 9&#8201;b,</p>

wood-cut portrait of Bunyan is indented in the
margin of this title-page. We also find one Hugh
Astley living ‘at St. Magnus corner,’ in 1607; and,
in 1677, R. Northcott kept ‘<em>the Marriner and Anchor
upon Fish-street Hill, near London Bridge</em>.’”</p>

<p>“Whilst you are speaking of the Booksellers and
Tradesmen who lived on old London Bridge, Mr.
Postern,” observed I, as he came to a period, “let me
add to your account some other circumstances which,
at various times, and from different sources, I have
collected illustrative of that subject. The sign of
‘<em>the Three Bibles</em>’ seems to have been a very favourite
device upon that edifice, and, most probably,
continued so until the houses were removed; for we
trace it into the eighteenth century, at which time
there were two shops so denominated; and one of
them also appears to have been famous for the sale of
a Patent Medicine, as you will find from the following
particulars communicated to me by Mr. John
Thomas Smith, Keeper of the Prints and Drawings in
the British Museum. ‘<cite>The Mariner’s Jewel; or, a
Pocket Companion for the Ingenious. By James Love,
Mathematician. The sixth edition, corrected and enlarged.
London. Printed for H. and J. Tracy, at the
Three Bibles on London Bridge. 1724.</cite>’ duodecimo.
At the end of the volume bearing this title, is an advertisement
of a medicine, called ‘<cite>The Balsam of
Chili</cite>,’ which is succeeded by the following curious
note. ‘All persons are desired to beware of a pretended
Balsam of Chili, which, for about these seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
years last past, hath been sold, and continues to be
sold, by Mr. John Stuart, at the <em>Old Three Bibles</em>,
as he calls his sign, although mine was the sign of
the Three Bibles twenty years before his. This pretended
Balsam sold by Mr. Stuart, resembles the true
Balsam in colour, and is put up in the same bottles;
but has been found to differ exceedingly from the
true sort by several persons, who, through the carelessness
of the buyers intrusted, have gone to the
wrong place. Therefore all persons who send, should
give strict order to enquire for the name Tracy; for
Mr. Stuart’s being the very same sign, it is an easy
matter to mistake. All other pretended Balsams of
Chili, sold elsewhere, are shams and impositions;
which may not only be ineffectual, but prove of worse
consequence. The right sort is to be had of H.
Tracy, at the Three Bibles on London Bridge, at
1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> a bottle, where it hath been sold these forty
years.’ There also appear to have been two Booksellers’
shops known by the sign of ‘<em>the Looking
Glass</em> on London Bridge;’ for you have already mentioned
that ‘<em>the Life and Death of John Overs</em>’ was
printed for T. Harris at such a sign, in 1744; and at
the very same time, as well as earlier, one T. Hodges
was an extensive publisher of popular books, ‘<cite>at the
Looking Glass on London Bridge over against St.
Magnus Church</cite>,’ as you will find in the title-pages to
a multitude of small volumes of that period. One of
the little tracts to which his name appears, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> ‘<cite>The
whole Life and merry exploits of bold Robin Hood,
Earl of Huntingdon</cite>,’ 1737. duodecimo; and we also
read the name of S. Crowder and Company, London
Bridge, attached to ‘<cite>The Delightful, Princely, and
Entertaining History of the Gentle Craft; adorn’d with
Pictures suitable to each story</cite>.’ 1760. duodecimo. I
could easily, Mr. Postern, increase this list of books
published on London Bridge, from the advertisements
which continually appeared in the columns of ‘<cite>The
Daily Post</cite>,’&mdash;‘<cite>The Daily Courant</cite>,’ and other Newspapers
of the early part of the last century, but I rather
wish to point out to you the names and signs of
some other persons dwelling in the same place; for
it seems to have been occupied by a variety of trades.
Thus, in 1722, we have John Body, Silversmith, at
the White Horse on London Bridge;&mdash;Hotham,
Bookseller, at the Black Boy; and E. Herne, Milliner,
at the Dolphin and Comb. The shop-bills of these
tradesmen, however, from whence we generally derive
this kind of information, are so exceedingly rare, that
after a very careful search through that extensive
collection belonging to the late Miss Banks, now preserved
in the Print Room of the British Museum,
I have found only <em>one</em>! although the Portfolios
contain many thousands. But what I there sought
for in vain, has been supplied to me from two private
sources; for Henry Smedley, Esq., of Whitehall, and
Mr. William Upcott, of the London Institution, are in
possession of impressions of several, of which they
have kindly permitted me to take the following
copies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>“1. A copper-plate shop-bill, card size, having the
figure of a Roebuck enclosed in a rich architectural
square frame, surmounted by a shield of arms, 3 roebucks
statant regardant, probably a copy from the sign
of the house. On the lower parts of the frame are the
date ‘1714,’ and the initials ‘<em>W. O.</em>;’ beneath which
is ‘<em>William Osborne, Leather seller, at the Roe-buck
upon London Bridge</em>.’</p>

<p>“2. A copper-plate shop-bill, 5 inches by 3&frac12;, having,
within a rich cartouche frame, a pair of embroidered
small-clothes and a glove; beneath is written ‘<em>Walter
Watkins, Breeches Maker, Leather Seller, and Glover,

<p>“3. The copper-plate head of a bill, ‘<em>London 17..,
Bought of Churcher and Christie, Leather Sellers and
Breeches Makers, at the Lamb and Breeches, London

<p>“4. Copper-plate shop-bill, 5<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches by 3&frac34;, with
the device of a Crown and Anchor, in a square cartouche
frame; below which appears ‘<em>James Brooke,

<p>“5. A small copper-plate Tobacco-paper, with a
coarse and rude engraving of a Negro smoking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
holding a roll of tobacco; above his head a crown,
two ships in full sail behind, and the sun issuing from
the right hand corner above. In the fore-ground are
four smaller Negroes planting and packing tobacco,
and beneath is written ‘<em>Iohn Winkley, Tobacconist,
near y<sup>e</sup> Bridge, In the Burrough Southwark, London</em>.’</p>

<p>“6. An elegant ornamental copper-plate shop-bill,
5<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches by 4<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, with an allegorical design of two
figures representing Genius and Prudence, with
books and articles of stationery below; and between
them, a circle, with the words, ‘<em>John Benskin, Stationer,
at y<sup>e</sup> Bible and Star on y<sup>e</sup> Bridge, London</em>.’</p>

<p>“One of the most eminent and well-known tradesmen
on London Bridge, however, was William Herbert,
the Print-seller, and Editor of Joseph Ames’s
‘<cite>Typographical Antiquities</cite>;’ who, upon his return
from India, having probably acquired a considerable
knowledge of the relative situations of the coasts,
countries, and rivers, which he had seen and surveyed
abroad, thought himself qualified to undertake the
occupation of an Engraver, and Publisher, of Maps
and Charts. With this view he took a house upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
London Bridge, and continued in it, until the houses
were taken down in 1757-58; when he removed to
Leadenhall Street, and thence to Goulston Square,
White-Chapel. The very first night which Mr. Herbert
spent in his house on London Bridge, there was
a dreadful fire in some part of the metropolis, on the
banks of the Thames; which, with several succeeding
ones, suggested to him the plan of a floating fire-engine.
He proposed it to Captain Hill, of the Royal
Exchange Assurance, who told him that ‘there must
be a fire every now and then for the benefit of the
insurance:’ Herbert, however, published his proposal
in the Gazetteer, and it was soon after adopted. You
will find these anecdotes originally printed in the
‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,’ for 1795, volume lxv., part i.,
page 262; supposed to have been written by Mr.
Gough; whence they were incorporated into the
Memoirs of Herbert, attached to the Rev. Dr. Dibdin’s
edition of the ‘<cite>Typographical Antiquities</cite>,’ volume i.,
London, 1810, quarto, page 76. The pretty copper-plate
shop-bill of Master Herbert is yet preserved in
a most beautiful state, in the vast collection of the late
Miss Banks, to which I have already alluded, volume
iii., class, <cite>Print-sellers</cite>. It bears the date of
1749, and represents a country view, surrounded by
columns, vases, temples, statues, &amp;c. On the left are
two figures, one in the full dress of the time, and the
other in a morning dress, exhibiting a portrait to him.
Round the whole print is a rich ancient frame, ornamented
with flowers, laurel branches, busts, books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
instruments, scrolls, and a globe standing in the centre
beneath. At the top is an eagle supporting a large
robe, or piece of drapery, which hangs half way down,
and on which the following words are inscribed in
ornamental writing. ‘<em>Great variety of English Maps
and Prints, plain and colour’d. Also French, and
other Foreign Prints, chiefly collected from the works
of the most celebrated artists. Sold by William Herbert,
at the Golden Globe, under the Piazzas on London
Bridge. N. B. Prints neatly framed and glazed for
Exportation, Rooms and Staircases fitted up in the
modern or Indian taste.</em>’</p>

<p>“Another source whence we derive much of our
information concerning the old shopkeepers of London,
and, of course, those of London Bridge, is to be found
in that species of unauthorised coin commonly known
by the name of Tradesmen’s Tokens. For many centuries,
you remember, gold and silver money only
was regularly current in this kingdom; for, though
the earliest inhabitants of Britain probably used
copper, there was none coined of an authorised mintage,
until the time of Charles II. The silver pence, and
even halfpence, which were previously current, were
of so minute a size, that, as an eminent author on
this subject observes, ‘a dozen of them might be in
a man’s pocket, and yet not be discovered without a
good magnifying glass;’ and, consequently, they were
not adapted to any very extensive circulation. To
remedy this, and to provide change for the increase
of retail trade, these Tokens were originally issued;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
being pieces of coin of a low value, to pass between
Grocers, Bakers, Vintners, &amp;c., by which the lower
classes might have smaller quantities of goods, than
they would otherwise be obliged to procure. These
Tokens were first issued about the latter end of the
reign of Henry VII., or the beginning of the following
one, when they were made of lead, tin, latten,
and even of leather. In the time of Elizabeth their
numbers increased; and, though the silver farthings,
coined by James I., and Charles I., for a while supplied
the want of small coins, yet, in the Civil Wars,
the private Tokens multiplied to a great excess, and
every petty tradesman had his pledges for a halfpenny
payable in silver, or its value in goods, to
bearer upon demand, at his shop: upon the credit of
which it therefore depended, whether they should
circulate through one or two streets, a whole town,
or to some little distance in the country round. The
London Gazettes for July the 25th, 1672, and February
the 23rd, 1673, contained advertisements
against these Tokens, and of the issuing of the first
national copper coinage, referring to ‘the Farthing
Office in Fen-Church Street,’ as the place of exchange.
Previously, however, to the issue of a lawful coinage
in 1797, the debased state of the copper money gave
rise to another general striking of Provincial and
Tradesmen’s Tokens, which was commenced by the
famous Anglesey Penny in 1784. Such, then, is a
general view of the nature and history of these coins,
and we now proceed to notice those which record for
us some particulars of London Bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>“The general impresses of these Tokens consisted
of the names, residences, initials, and signs of their
owners, by whom they were issued and paid; and the
quantity used in London was so great, that Sir
Robert Cotton supposed, about 1612, that there were
3000 persons who cast leaden Tokens to the amount
of &pound;5. annually, upon the average; of which they
had not one tenth remaining at the year’s end. Notwithstanding
this immense quantity, we meet with
but few relating to London Bridge; and yet, by the
experience and kindness of Edward Hawkins, Esq.,
Assistant Keeper of the Coins and Medals of the
British Museum, and of Mr. M. Young, the well-known
Dealer in those articles, I am furnished with a
list, and drawings, of most of those which are known
to be extant, and of which I shall now give you a description.</p>

<p>“Such, then, are some specimens of the Tradesmen’s
Tokens current on London Bridge; and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
they are sufficiently rude in their workmanship, and
base in their metal, yet with some collectors, they are
of a far greater degree of rarity, and of value too,
than the handsomest modern silver coin you could
present them with. You will observe, however,
that I have noticed those Tokens only, on which
the Bridge is actually mentioned; but an extensive
list of such as were issued in Southwark, will be
found in Messrs. Manning’s and Bray’s ‘<cite>History
of Surrey</cite>,’ already referred to, volume iii., Appendix,
pages cxi-cxv. Let me add too, that my
authorities for these historical notices of coins, have
been ‘<cite>An Essay on Medals</cite>,’ by John Pinkerton,
London, 1789, octavo, volume i.; and ‘<cite>Annals of the
Coinage of Britain</cite>,’ by the Rev. Rogers Ruding,
London, 1819, octavo, volume iii., pages 127, 319,
324, volume iv., page 61. I must not, however, conclude
these particulars of the numismatic reliques of London
Bridge, without observing to you that there are
some Medalets also extant, commemorative of its
buildings. Of these coins we find a list in James
Conder’s elegant volumes, entitled ‘<cite>An Arrangement
of Provincial Coins, Tokens, and Medalets, issued in
Great Britain, Ireland, and the Colonies, within the
last twenty years, from the farthing to the penny size</cite>.’
Ipswich, 1798, octavo. Medalets, you know, Mr.
Postern, are of that description of coins which were
struck by the Romans, and used for scattering to the
people upon solemn occasions: and those of which I
am now speaking are of the class distinguished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
bearing the representation of public buildings. In
volume i., pages 72 and 73, of Mr. Conder’s work, are
mentioned the following Medalets of London Bridge,
of the penny size, executed by P. Kempson.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think, Mr. Barnaby Postern, that
there have been several traditional mistakes perpetuated,
as to persons supposed to have dwelt upon
London Bridge; for, upon investigating the subject,
I can find no authority to support my recording them
as inhabitants of that part of London. The author
of an exceedingly amusing work, entitled ‘<cite>Wine and
Walnuts</cite>,’ London, 1823, octavo, in which are contained
many witty scenes and curious conversations of eminent
characters in the last century, has entitled the
seventh chapter of his second volume ‘<cite>Old London
Bridge; with portraits of some of its inhabitants</cite>.’ In
this article, on page 81, we are told that ‘Master
John Bunyan, one of your heaven-born geniuses, resided,
for some time, upon London Bridge;’ though I
cannot discover any such circumstance in either of
the lives of that good man now extant, though he certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
preached, for some time, at a Chapel in Southwark.
Perhaps, however, this assertion may be explained
by the following passage from the Preface affixed
to the Index attached to the first volume of ‘<cite>The
Labours of that eminent servant of Christ Mr. John
Bunyan</cite>,’ London, 1692, folio. It is there stated, that
in 1688 ‘he published six books, being the time of
K. James 2d’s. liberty of conscience, and was seized
with a sweating distemper, of which, after his some
weeks going about, proved his death, at his very
loving friend’s Mr. Strudwick’s, a Grocer,’&mdash;at the
sign of the Star,&mdash;‘at <em>Holborn Bridge</em>, London, on
August 31st.’ It is also recorded on the same page of
‘<cite>Wine and Walnuts</cite>,’ that ‘Master Abel, the great
importer of wines, was another of the marvels of old
London Bridge; he set up a sign, Thank God I am
<em>Abel</em>, quoth the wag, and had, in front of his house,
the sign of a bell.’ As I have also heard the same
particulars repeated elsewhere, it is possible that there
may be some traditionary authority for them; but
upon carefully reading over the very rare tracts relating
to Mr. Alderman Abel, preserved in the British
Museum, I find nothing concerning his residence on
London Bridge, and I should rather imagine, from
their statements, that he lived at his Ticket, or Patent
Office, situate in Aldermary Church-Yard. The same
chapter, however, contains some authentic notices of
Artists who really did live upon this venerable edifice.
Of these, one of the most eminent was Hans Holbein,
the great painter of the Court of Henry VIII.; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
though we can hardly suppose that he inhabited the
Nonesuch House, yet his actual residence here is certified
by Lord Orford, in his ‘<cite>Anecdotes of Painting</cite>,’
vide his ‘<cite>Works</cite>,’ edit. London, 1798-1822, quarto,
volume iii., page 72, note. ‘The father of the Lord
Treasurer Oxford’&mdash;says the noble author in that
place,&mdash;‘passing over London Bridge, was caught in
a shower; and stepping into a goldsmith’s shop for
shelter, he found there a picture of Holbein,&mdash;who
had lived in that house,&mdash;and his family. He offered
the goldsmith &pound;100. for it, who consented to let him
have it, but desired first to shew it to some persons.
Immediately after, happened the fire of London, and
the picture was destroyed.’ Another famous Artist of
London Bridge, who is mentioned in both the works
which I last cited, was Peter Monamy; so excellent
a painter of marine subjects, as to be considered but
little inferior to Vandevelde himself. Lord Orford
says of him, at page 421, that he ‘received his first
rudiments of drawing from a sign and house-painter
on London Bridge;’&mdash;and that ‘the shallow waves,
that rolled under his window, taught young Monamy
what his master could not teach him, and fitted him
to paint the turbulence of the ocean.’ This artist
died at Westminster in 1749. We are also informed,
by Edward Edwards, in his ‘<cite>Continuation of Walpole’s
Anecdotes of Painting</cite>,’ London, 1808, quarto, page 214,
that Dominic Serres, the Marine Painter, who died in
1793, also once kept a shop upon London Bridge. To
these celebrated men, the author of ‘<cite>Wine and Walnuts</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>’
adds Jack Laguerre, the Engraver, ‘a great humourist,
wit, singer, player, caricaturist, mimic, and
a good scene-painter,’ son to that Louis, who painted
stair-cases and saloons, where, as Pope says, ‘sprawl
the saints of Verrio and Laguerre.’ His residence,
according to our lively author, who states that he
received his information from ‘old Dr. Monsey and
others,’ was on the first floor of the dwelling of a
waggish bookseller, and author of all-work, named
Crispin Tucker; the owner of half-a-shop on the
East side, under the Southern gate. The artist’s
<em>studio</em> was, chiefly, in a bow-windowed back room,
which projected over the Thames, and trembled at
every half-ebb tide; in which Hogarth had resided
in his early life, when he engraved for old John
Bowles, of the Black Horse in Cornhill. It resembled,
we are told, on page 135 of the work and
volume which I have already quoted, one of the alchemist’s
laboratories from the pencil of the elder
Teniers. It was ‘a complete smoke-stained confusionary,
with a German-stove, crucibles, pipkins,
nests of drawers, with rings of twine to pull them
out; here a box of asphaltum, there glass-stoppered
bottles, varnishes, dabbers, gravers, etching-tools,
walls of wax, obsolete copper-plates, many engraved
on both sides, caricatures, and poetry scribbled over
the walls; a pallet hung up as an heir-loom, the
colours dry upon it, hard as stone; an easel; all the
multifarious <em>arcanalia</em> of engraving, and, lastly, a
Printing-press!’ This curious picture is also from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
information of Dr. Monsey, but I cannot produce
you any other authority for its truth; and I shall
likewise, therefore, leave you to read, and judge for
yourself, the amusing account of Dean Swift’s and
Pope’s visits and conversations with Crispin Tucker,
of London Bridge, in chapters viii. and ix. of the work
I have referred to.</p>

<p>“It was, however, not only the ordinary buildings
in the Bridge-street, which were formerly occupied as
shops and warehouses, but even the Chapel of St.
Thomas, which, in its later years, was called Chapel-House,
and the Nonesuch-House, were used for similar
purposes before they were taken down. Mr.
John Nichols, in his ‘<cite>Literary Anecdotes</cite>,’ tells us,
volume vi., part i., page 402, note, on the authority
of Dr. Ducarel, that ‘the house over the Chapel belonged
to Mr. Baldwin, Haberdasher, who was born
there; and when, at seventy-one, he was ordered to
go to Chislehurst for a change of air, he could not
sleep in the country, for want of the noise,’&mdash;the
roaring and rushing of the tide beneath the Bridge,&mdash;‘he
had been always used to hear.’ My good
friend, Mr. J. T. Smith, too, in his very interesting
volume of the ‘<cite>Ancient Topography of London</cite>,’ which
you have already quoted, page 26, has also the following
observations concerning the modern use of
this Chapel. ‘By the <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite>,’ says he,
‘for April 26th, 1798, it appears that Aldermen Gill
and Wright had been in partnership upwards of fifty
years; and that their shop stood on the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
London Bridge, and their warehouse for paper was
directly under it, which was a Chapel for divine
service, in one of the old arches; and, long within
legal memory, the service was performed every sabbath
and Saint’s day. Although the floor was always,
at high-water mark, from ten to twelve feet under
the surface; yet such was the excellency of the materials
and the masonry, that not the least damp, or
leak, ever happened, and the paper was kept as safe
and dry as it would have been in a garret.’ In that
‘<cite>Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster</cite>,’
printed in 1734, and purporting to have been compiled
by Robert Seymour, Esq., but which was in
reality the production of the Rev. John Motley, the
famous collector of Joe Miller’s Jests, it is stated in
volume i., book i., page 48, that at that time one side
of the Nonesuch House was inhabited by Mr. Bray,
a Stationer, and the other by Mr. West, a Dry-Salter.
So much then, Mr. Barnaby, for the few anecdotes
which I have been able to collect of the dwellings and
inhabitants of old London Bridge.”</p>

<p>“And a very fair Memorial too, Master Geoffrey,”
answered the Antiquary, “especially when we consider
the extreme difficulty of procuring such information
as this is: but, to carry on our history, I
must now enter upon a less amusing subject; the
summary of the Bridge Accounts for the years 1624
and 1625, taken from the printed sheet which I have
so often cited. ‘1624. To John Langley, and Richard
Foxe, Bridge-Masters, half a year’s fee at our Lady-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
&pound;50: and for the other half year augmented by
order of the Court of Aldermen, &pound;66. 8<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>, and for
their Liveries, &amp;c. &pound;6. Total &pound;122. 8<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> Rental
&pound;2054. 4<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>&mdash;1625. To the said Bridge-Masters,
&pound;133. 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> Liveries, &amp;c. &pound;6. Total to each of them,
&pound;69. 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> Rental, &pound;2054. 4<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>’ These notices of
the prosperity of this edifice, conduct us down to the
time when so much of its glory was lost in devastating
flames and mouldering ruins.</p>

<p>“The year 1632-33 must be ever memorable in
the history of London Bridge: for scarcely in the
awful conflagration which consumed almost the whole
City, did our brave old edifice suffer so severely.
And now, Mr. Barbican, you must forgive me if I be
a little prolix in describing that desolating fire, since
it not only destroyed more than a third part of the
Bridge Houses, but, at one time, its ravages were
feared even in the City itself. I shall commence my
account then by reminding you that Richard Bloome,
one of Stow’s continuators, on page 61 of his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
thus speaks of the calamity. ‘On the 13th day of
February, between eleven and twelve at night, there
happened in the house of one Briggs, a Needle-maker
near St. Magnus Church, at the North end of the
Bridge, by the carelessness of a Maid-Servant setting
a tub of hot sea-coal ashes under a pair of stairs, a
sad and lamentable fire, which consumed all the
buildings before eight of the clock the next morning,
from the North end of the Bridge to the first vacancy
on both sides, containing forty-two houses; water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
then being very scarce, the Thames being almost
frozen over. Beneath, in the vaults and cellars, the
fire remained glowing and burning a whole week
after.’</p>

<p>“There are not wanting several general views of
London taken before this fire, by which we are made
acquainted with those extensive piles of dwellings
it destroyed; several of which I have already mentioned
to you. Another also, which is most excellent
and rare, is that entitled in Latin, ‘<em>London the most
flourishing City of Britain, and the most celebrated emporium
of the whole world</em>.’ It was engraven by John
Visscher in 1616, and published in Holland, ‘by Jud.
Hondius at the sign of the Watchful Dog;’ a four sheet
print measuring 7 feet 1&frac12; inch by 1 foot 4&frac34; inches,
with an English description beneath it. ‘A Capital
View,’ adds Gough, in his ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ already
cited, volume i., page 749, ‘the plates destroyed in
Holland about twenty years ago. T. Davies sold the
only impression of it to the King for ten guineas.’
There is, likewise, a variation of this view, without a
date, having eight Latin verses at either corner, with
the name of ‘Ludovicus Hondius Lusitt.’ It is, says
Mr. J. T. Smith, in his ‘<cite>Ancient Topography of London</cite>,’
page 25, ‘extremely well executed, and exhibits
a wind-mill standing in the Strand, very near where
the New Church is now erected; and another above
the Water-works at Queenhithe.’ He considers it as

that the Palace of Whitehall appears in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
original state, before the Banquetting House and
York and Somerset Water-gates were erected by
Inigo Jones. It is also shewn to be a view of the
time of King James I., by a royal procession being
introduced on the water, in which the royal barge is
surmounted by the thistle. London Bridge forms
a very large and important feature in this engraving,
and I have been informed, that the edifice alone was
copied in quarto, for the work entitled ‘<cite>London before
the Great Fire</cite>;’ but as that publication stopped with
the second number, it was never exhibited for sale.</p>

<div>
<p>Of the very curious print by Visscher, however,&mdash;and
I must not forget to observe that a fine impression
of it is in the possession of John Dent, Esq.&mdash;there
was also an imitation of the same size, but somewhat
inferior, called, from the place where it was engraven,
‘the Venetian copy of Visscher’s View.’ It is, like its
prototype, entitled in Latin, ‘<cite>London the most flourishing
City in Britain</cite>,’ &amp;c. to which is added,
‘<em>Printed in Venice, by Nicolo Misserini, 1629, Franco
Valegio fecit</em>:’ it also contains a Latin dedication,
and a description in Italian. There is an impression,
probably, of this latter print, preserved in volume xiii.
of the famous illustrated Pennant’s London, bequeathed
by the late Charles Crowle, Esq. to the
British Museum; but all the inscriptions have been
cruelly cut away, and the print itself doubled in numerous
folds to make it fit to the size of the volume!
This engraving, however, bears the name of Rombout
Vanden Hoege, and shews us, with great minuteness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
on rather a large scale, the <span class="smcap">Group of Buildings

<p class="pc">which extended to the first opening, and which, from
the very appearance which they present, must have
contained a considerable number of inhabitants; but
of the fire itself, and of all the distressing events attending
it, I am about to give you a very particular
and interesting account, from the pen of an eye-witness
of the conflagration. This narrative is contained
in a coarse paper Manuscript volume, of a
small quarto size, written in the print-hand of the
17th century, with some lines of faded red ink and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
chalk interspersed. The volume contains 517 pages
in all, and is entitled ‘<cite>A Record of the Mercies of
God; or, a Thankefull Remembrance</cite>;’ it being a collection,
or journal, of remarkable providences and
reflections, made by one Nehemiah Wallington, a
Puritan Citizen and Turner, who lived in Little East-cheap,
and who was evidently a friend of Burton and
Bastwick, he having been several times examined
concerning them before the Court of Star-Chamber.
In this most singular record then, at pages 479-488,
is an article entitled ‘<cite>Of the great fire vpon the
Bridge</cite>;’ preceded by Mottoes from Psalms lxvi. 5;
lxxi. 17; cxi. 2; Isaiah xlv. 7; and Amos iii. 6;
which runs in the following terms.</p>
</div>

<p>“‘1633. It is the bounden dutie of vs all that
haue beene the beholders of the wonderfull workes
of the Lord our God, his mercyes and iudgements
shewed heretofore; and now of late of a fearefull
fire, wee should not forgett itt ourselues, and we
should declare it to all others, euen to y<sup>e</sup> generations
to come.&mdash;On the xi. day of February, (being
Monday, 1633) began, by God’s iust hand, a fearefull
fire in the house of one Mr. Iohn Brigges, neere tenn
of the clocke att night, it burnt down his house and
the next house, with all the goods that were in them;
and, as I heere, that Briggs, his wife, and childe,
escaped with their liues very hardly, hauing nothing
on their bodies but their shurt and smoke: and the
fire burnt so fearcely, that itt could not be quenched
till it had burnt downe all the houses on both sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the way, from S. Magnes Church to the first open
place. And allthough there was water enough very
neere, yet they could not safely come at it, but all the
conduittes neere were opened, and the pipes that
carried watter through the streets were cutt open, and
the watter swept down with broomes with helpe
enough; but it was the will of God it should not
preuaile. And the hand of God was the more seene
in this, in as much as no meanes would prosper. For
the 3 Engines, which are such excellent things,
that nothing that euer was deuised could do so much
good, yet none of these did prosper, for they were
all broken, and the tide was verie low that they could
get no watter; and the pipes that were cutt yeilded
but littel watter. Some ladders were broke to the
hurt of many, for some had their legges broke, some
had their armes, and some their ribbes broken, and
many lost their liues. This fire burnt fiercely all
night, and part of the next day (for my man was there
about twelue a cloke, and he said he did see the
fardest house on fire) till all was burnt and pulled
downe to the ground. Yet the timber, and wood,
and coales in the sellers, could not be quenched all
that weeke, till the Tuesday following, in the afternoone,
the xix of February, for I was there then my
selfe, and had a liue cole of fire in my hand, and burnt
my finger with it. Notwithstanding there were as
many night and day as could labour one by another
to carry away timber, and brickes, and tiles, and rubbish
cast downe into the liters. So that on Wensday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the Bridge was cleared that passengers might goe
ouer.’</p>

<p>“‘At the begining of this fire, as I lay in my bed
and heard y<sup>e</sup> sweeping of the channels and crying for
water, water, I arose about one of the cloke, and
looked downe Fish-street-hill, and did behold such a
fearfull and dreadfull fire vaunting it selfe ouer the
tops of houses, like a Captaine florishing and displaying
his banner; and seeing so much meanes and
so little good, it did make me thinke of that fire
which the Lord threateneth against Ierusalem, for
the breach of his Sabbath day. He saith thus: ‘But
if ye will not here me to sanctifie the Sabbath day,
and to beare no burden, nor to goe through y<sup>e</sup> gates
of Ierusalem in the Sabbath day, then will I kindle
a fire in y<sup>e</sup> gates there, and it shall deuoure the palaces
of Ierusalem, and it shall not be quenched.’
Iere. xvii. 27.</p>

<p>“‘I did heere that on the other side of y<sup>e</sup> Bridge,
the Bruers brought abundance of watter in vessells
on their draies, which did, with the blissing of God,
much good; and this mircie of God I thought on,
that there was but littel wind; for had y<sup>e</sup> wind bin
as high as it was a weeke before, I thinke it would
have indangered y<sup>e</sup> most part of the Citie; for in
Thames Street there is much pitch, tarre, rosen, and
oyle, in their houses: Therefore, as God remembers
mercy in iustice, let us remember thankefullnes in
sorrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span> ‘Therefore will I praise the Lord with my

<p>“This narrative has, however, already appeared in
print in the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>’ for November,
1824, pages 387, 388; the extract having been furnished
by the possessor of the volume, Mr. William
Upcott, of the London Institution.</p>

<div>
<p>“Of the ground-plot of London Bridge, after the
damage done by this fire, there is yet extant a very
curious survey, preserved under the care of Mr.
Smith, in the British Museum. It consists of an unpublished
drawing on parchment, measuring four
feet five inches in length, by ten inches in breadth:
and it, perhaps, belonged to Sir Hans Sloane, as it is
kept with some other fragmenta of his property. In
this drawing, the piers are represented in a tint of
yellow, placed upon sterlings of Indian ink; and it
was executed, as I suppose, soon after this fatal conflagration,
since there is a note written in an ancient
hand attached to the seventh pier from the City end,
stating that ‘<em>the Fire burnt to the prickt line</em>,’ which
is drawn from it; and which accords with all the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
views taken of the platform, and houses on
the Bridge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/422.jpg" width="700" height="190" alt="" title="Ground Plan of the Old Stone Bridge of London after the Fire of 1632-33." />
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am next to speak,” continued my unwearied
Historian, “of the manner in which this terrible destruction
of London Bridge was repaired: and concerning
this we are informed by Richard Bloome, a
Continuator of Stow, who tells us in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i., page 61, that after the fire, ‘this North
end of the Bridge lay unbuilt for many years, only
deal boards were set up on both sides, to prevent
people’s falling into the Thames, many of which deals
were, by high winds, oft blown down, which made it
very dangerous in the nights, although there were lanthorns
and candles hung upon all the cross beams that
held the pales together.’ We have two views of London
Bridge, in which the Northern end of it appears
in this state, but in each of them the temporary erection
is quite of a different nature; and it is somewhat
singular that the writer whom I last cited, should
positively speak as follows, concerning the early restoration
of the destroyed houses, when there seems no
real authority to support his assertions. ‘For about
the year 1645,’&mdash;says he,&mdash;‘the North end of this
part last burned, began to be rebuilt; and in the year
1646 was finished: the building was of timber, very
substantial and beautiful, for the houses were three
stories high, besides the cellars, which were within
and between the piers. And over the houses were
stately platforms leaded, with rails and ballusters
about them, very commodious and pleasant for
walking, and enjoying so fine a prospect up and down
the River; and some had pretty little gardens with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
arbours. This half being finished, the other half was
intended to be rebuilt answerable to this, which
would have been a great glory to the Bridge and
honour to the City, the street, or passage, being twenty
feet broad; whereas the other part, at the South end,
was not above fourteen, and, in some places, but
twelve.’</p>

<div>
<p>“Now, notwithstanding this particular description
of these new buildings, neither of the engravings which
I have alluded to have any indications of them; although
one of them was published in 1647, and the
other in 1666. The first of these represents the North
end of London Bridge, from St. Magnus’ Church to
the houses beyond the first opening, as occupied by a
<em>covered</em> passage formed of planks, leaving recesses
standing out from the main erection, which was supported
by buttresses of wood fastened to platforms on
the outside of the Bridge.</p>

</div>

<div>
<p>“We derive this view of the dilapidations of London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
Bridge from a very rare and magnificent print, well
known to collectors and antiquaries, by the name of the
‘<cite>Long Antwerp view of London</cite>;’ for which, Mr. Geoffrey
Barbican, if you ever meet with it, you may consider
twenty guineas as a very moderate price. This
famous engraving is an etching by the matchless Wenceslaus
Hollar; it is in seven sheets, measuring two
yards and an half in length, by 17&frac12; inches in height:
it bears a dedication to Queen Henrietta Maria, and
William Prince of Orange, with a copy of Latin verses
written by Edward Benlowes, Esq.; and, though it was
sold in London, the following publication line appears
on one side written in Latin:&mdash;‘<em>Sold at Amsterdam by
Cornelius Danckers, in Calf Street, at the sign of the
Image of Gratitude, in the year 1647</em>.’ The e is, by
the way, a pretty fair, but smaller copy of this view
of London and Westminster in two sheets, in a series
of prints commonly called ‘<cite>Boydell’s Perspectives</cite>,’
measuring 37&frac12; inches, by 10&frac14; inches, signed ‘<em>R.
Benning, del. et sculp.</em>,’ and entitled ‘<cite>A View of
London as it was in the year 1647</cite>.’ The publication
line is, ‘<em>Sold by J. Boydell, Engraver, at the Unicorn
in Cheapside, London, 1756</em>.’ You will find both the
original, and the copy, in the xiii.th and xiv.th volumes
of Mr. Crowle’s Illustrated Pennant, which I have already
cited to you, and the view takes in from above the
Parliament House at Westminster to beyond St. Catherine’s;
but the Bridge is the <em>keimelion</em> of the plate,
for that noble edifice is represented with all its buildings,
from St. Magnus’ Church, down to the Southwark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Tower, the size of 10 inches in length, with the principal
buildings about two inches square. The other
view to which I have alluded, was also etched by
Hollar, upon two sheets measuring 27 inches by 4&frac14;:
and it consists of two prospects, one over the other, on
the same plate, the upper one representing, ‘<em>London
from St. Mary Overies Steeple in Southwark, in its flourishing
condition before the Fire</em>;’ and the lower one
entitled, ‘<cite>Another prospect of the said City, taken
from the same place, as it appeareth now after the said
calamity and destruction by Fire</cite>.’ Copies of these
interesting etchings are, however, neither dear nor
uncommon; though, if you would have so fine an impression
as that in the Print Room of the British Museum,
you will scarcely procure it under three Guineas.
In the upper of these prospects, the Northern end of
London Bridge is shewn to be a passage fenced by
wooden palings without any houses, excepting one
building, which occupies the whole width of the
Bridge; having a gate in it surmounted by the King’s
Arms, and standing immediately before the old Church
of St. Magnus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>“Independently of these views, we have another
very strong evidence that this part was not built upon
even in the year 1665, contained in that most interesting
and curious work, the ‘<cite>Memoirs and Diary
of Samuel Pepys, Esq., F.R.S. and Secretary to the
Admiralty in the reigns of Charles II. and James II</cite>.’
Edited by Richard, Lord Braybrooke, London, 1825,
4to. volume 1., page 388: where, under the date of
January 24th, 1665-66, that observant journalist has
the following entry. ‘My Lord,’&mdash;Edward Montague,
Earl of Sandwich,&mdash;‘and I, the weather being a little
fairer, went by water to Deptford; and the wind
being again very furious, so as we durst not go by
water, walked to London round the Bridge, no boat
being able to stirre; and, Lord! what a dirty walk
we had, and so strong the wind, that in the fields we
many times could not carry our bodies against it, but
were driven backwards. It was dangerous to walk
the streets, the bricks and tiles falling from the houses,
that the whole streets were covered with them; and
whole chimneys, nay, whole houses, in two or three
places, blowed down. But above all, <em>the pales on
London Bridge, on both sides, were blown away</em>;’&mdash;almost
the very words, you observe, which I have
quoted you from Richard Bloome,&mdash;‘so that we were
forced to stoop very low, for fear of blowing off the
Bridge. We could see no boats in the Thames afloat,
but what were broke loose, and carried through the
Bridge, it being ebbing water. And the greatest
sight of all was, among other parcels of ships driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
here and there in clusters together, one was quite
overset, and lay with her masts all along in the
water, and her keel above water.’ The desolation,
and wintry chillness of this picture, is enough to
make one shiver even in the Dog-days.”</p>

<p>When the worthy old Chronicler had arrived at
the conclusion of this narrative, as usual I took up
the story, and began thus:&mdash;“This, Mr. Barnaby
Postern, was indeed a fatal destruction, and one would
imagine that it was no such happy event as to cause a
jesting ballad to be made to commemorate it; but
yet, though in the following verses there are some
discordant circumstances, and even the date is at variance
with that which you have already given, there
can be little doubt but that they relate to the Fire of
which you have now spoken. You will find them
printed at the end of a very rare, but, at the same
time, a very worthless publication, entitled ‘<cite>The
Loves of Hero and Leander, a mock Poem: Together
with choice Poems and rare pieces of drollery, got by
heart, and often repeated by divers witty Gentlemen and
Ladies that use to walke in the New Exchange, and at
their recreations in Hide Park</cite>.’ London, 1653, 12mo.,
pages 44-48. There is also another edition of 1682;
but I pray you to remember, that many of the fescennine
rhymes, some of which would have done
honour to Hudibras, and many of the witty points
of this song, are, in that latter copy, most vilely perverted;
I shall give it you, therefore, as it stands in
the former impression.</p>

<p>“And now, Sir, I shall, by your favour, say a few
words with respect to the tune to which these verses
were formerly sung; which I am the better enabled
to do by the researches of a gentleman, to whom, in
several other particulars of our history, I have
been considerably indebted. By his information, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
shall first inform you, that the foregoing Song exists
in its original state, in the Pepysian Collection of
Ballads preserved in Magdalen College, Cambridge,
volume ii., page 146; where it is called ‘<cite>The Lamentation
of a bad market, or the drownding of three
children on the Thames. To the tune of the Ladies’
Fall. Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, and
J. Clarke.</cite>’ Now the old verses, entitled ‘<cite>A Lamentable
Ballad of the Lady’s Fall</cite>,’ you will find, with
some account of it prefixed, in Bishop Percy’s ‘<cite>Reliques
of Ancient English Poetry</cite>,’ volume iii., book ii.,
article x., page 137, fourth edition, London, 1794,
octavo; or, indeed, you may consult any edition but the
last. From the Editor’s notice of this latter poem,
we learn that it was sung to the tune of the verses
called ‘<cite>The Shepherd’s Slumber</cite>;’ better known by
the first three words of the commencing stanza.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div>
<p>“I have not, Mr. Barnaby, found the musical notation
of <em>this</em> song, though I am almost inclined to think
it was sung to the very common tune of ‘<cite>Flying
Fame</cite>,’ so familiar to every body under the name of
‘<cite>Chevy Chace</cite>;’ for in volume iv., page 1, of Tom
D’Urfey’s collection of Songs called ‘<cite>Wit and Mirth</cite>,’
London, 1719, 12mo., you may see this very ballad on
London Bridge, entitled ‘<cite>Three children sliding on
the Thames. Tune, Chevy chace</cite>.’ Listen then, my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Sir, whilst, with my very unmelodious voice, I attempt
to give you some idea of it;&mdash;the music I have alluded
to, runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thank ye, thank ye, honest Master Geoffrey Barbican,”
said my visitor, as I concluded; “my thanks
to you, both for your music and poetry; for I verily
think as you do, that the verses which you have repeated
relate to this conflagration of 1633, although
there was the difference of a month between the actual
fact, and your rhyming record of it. It appears
to me, too, as if I recognized in the 16th stanza,&mdash;where
the last words of the drowning victim are
uttered by his head in broken accents,&mdash;the original
of Gay’s description of the death of Doll, the Pippin-woman,
contained in the 2nd book of his ‘<cite>Trivia</cite>,’
since she died in much the same place and manner.</p>

<p>“The rental of the Bridge House was, doubtless
considerably lessened by this destructive fire; but in
the printed document of the Bridge-Masters’ Accounts,
there is not any notice of the amount of rents for
some years after it. In 1636, however, we are informed
that the salaries, horsekeeping, and liveries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
of John Potter, and David Bourne, the Wardens, amounted
to &pound;71. 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> each; and in the following
year the rental is stated to have been only &pound;1836. 7<em>s.</em>
6<em>d.</em>, whilst the fees, &amp;c. of John Hawes and Noadiah
Rawlins amounted to &pound;72. In that Manuscript
treatise on the payment of Tythes, which I
have mentioned to you as being in the Archiepiscopal
Library at Lambeth, Cornelius Burgess, the then
Rector of St. Magnus, observes that ‘the best third
part of the Parish was consumed by the late fire on
London Bridge: yet no part of the annual charges
lying on the Parsonage is abated. And it is yet capable
of a large improvement, by reason that a good
part of it being Citty land, provisions have been
accordingly made to keepe downe the tithes generally
throughout the Parish to vnreasonable low proportions,
some very few houses excepted.’ According to
Newcourt, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Repertorium Ecclesiasticum</cite>,’ volume
i., page 396, these tythes before this conflagration
amounted to &pound;109. for 90 houses, of which about
40 houses were destroyed; though, in the Manuscript
valuation of 1638, they are reduced to &pound;81. 12<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em></p>

<p>“The destruction of London Bridge, however, was
not allowed to pass without a more appropriate memorial
than the song which you have repeated; for
in the parochial records of the Church adjoining, it is
stated, that Susanna Chambers by her will, dated the
28th day of December, 1640, left ‘unto the Parson of
the Parish Church of St. Magnus, on, or near, London
Bridge, or unto such other Preacher of God’s word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
as my said son Richard Chambers, his heirs, administrators,
and assignees shall yearly appoint, the yearly
sum of twenty shillings of lawful English money,
for a Sermon to be preached on the 12th day of February,
in every year, within the said Parish Church
of St. Magnus, London Bridge, or any other near
thereunto, in commemoration of God’s merciful preservation
of the said Church of St. Magnus from ruin
in the late and terrible fire of London Bridge; and
also the sum of seventeen shillings and sixpence to
the poor of that Parish of St. Magnus; and two
shillings and sixpence to the clerk and sexton.’ This
gift is mentioned by most of the London Historians;
and I would observe to you that I am informed, with
regard to the present state of this bequest, that the
money for the Sermon, the Clerk, and the Sexton,
has not been claimed within the memory of the oldest
inhabitant of the Parish: but that the poor have, ever
since, duly received their legacy. Whilst I am speaking
of St. Magnus’ Church, I may also remark,
that in consequence of the dissolution of the Fraternity
belonging to it, which I have before mentioned,
there has been a perpetuity of &pound;21. 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> paid by the
Exchequer ever since the time of Queen Mary.</p>

<p>“In the 43rd volume of that most extraordinary
collection of Tracts, which the late excellent King
George III. presented to the British Museum, there
is a pamphlet of four leaves commemorating a remarkable
flow of the Thames at London Bridge, the
title to which is given by Gough in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span> ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’
volume i., page 731: and it bears the
same proportion to its contents, as the show-cloth of
a travelling menagerie does to the actual exhibition.
‘<cite>A Strange Wonder, or the Citie’s Amazement. Being
a Relation occasioned by a wonderfull and vnusuall accident,
that happened in the River of Thames, Friday,
Feb. 4, 1641. There flowing Two Tydes at London
Bridge, within the space of an houre and a halfe, the
last comming with such violence and hideous noyse, that
it not onely affrighted, but even astonished above 500
watermen that stood beholding it on both sides the
Thames. Which latter Tyde rose sixe foote higher then
the former Tyde had done, to the great admiration of
all men.</cite>’ London, 1641. Small quarto. This tract is
subsequently named ‘<cite>True Newes from Heaven</cite>,’ and
the author takes occasion, from the event which he
records, to lament the vices and confusion of his time.
The fact itself occupies but a small portion of his
text; and he relates it thus.&mdash;‘Fryday, Februarie 4,
1641, it was high water at one of the clocke at noone,
a time&mdash;by reason so accommodated for all imployments
by water or land,&mdash;very fit to afford witnesse of
a strange and notorious accident. After it was full
high water, and that it flowed its full due time as all
Almanacks set downe; and water-men, the vnquestionable
prognosticators in that affaire, with confidence
mainetaine it stood a quiet still dead water, a full
houre and halfe, without moving or returning any
way never so litle: Yea, the water-men flung in
stickes to the streame, as near as they could guesse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
which lay in the water as vpon the earth, without
moving this way or that. Dishes likewise, and
wodden buckets, they set a swimming, but it proved
a stilling, for move they would not any way by force
of stream or water; so that it seemed the water was
indeed asleepe or dead, or had changed or borrowed
the stability of the earth. The water-men not content
with this evidence, would needs make the vtmost of
the tryall, that they might report with the more
boldnesse the truth of the matter: and with more
credible confidence they tooke their boates and
lanched into the streame or very channell: but the
boates that lay hailed up on the shore moved as much,
except when they used their oares; nay,&mdash;a thing
worthy the admiration of all men,&mdash;they rowed under
the very arches, tooke up their oares and slept there,
or, at least, lay still an houre very neare, their boates
not so much as moved through any way, either upward
or downeward: the water seeming as plaine,
quiet, even, and stable as a pavement under the arch,
where, if any where in the Thames, there must be
moving by reason of the narrownesse of the place.
In this posture stood the water a whole houre and
halfe, or rather above, by the testimony of above five
hundred water-men, on either side the Thames, whom
not to believe in this case were stupiditie, not discretion.
At last, when all men expected its ebb, being
filled with amazement that it stood so long as hath
been delivered, behold a greater wonder, a new Tyde
comes in! A new Tyde with a witnesse, you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
easily take notice of him; so lowde he roared, that
the noise was guessed to be about Greenwich when
it was heard so, not onely clearly, but fearfully to
the Bridge; and up he comes tumbling, roaring,
and foaming in that furious manner, that it was
horror unto all that beheld it. And as it gave sufficient
notice to the eare of its comming, so it left sufficient
satisfaction to the eye that it was now come;
having raised the water foure foote higher then the
first Tyde had done, foure foote by rule! as by
evident measure did appear, and presently ebbed in
as hasty, confused, unaccustomed manner. See here,
Reader! a wonder, that&mdash;all things considered,&mdash;the
oldest man never saw or heard of the like.’</p>

<p>“Lord Clarendon, in his ‘<cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>,’
volume i., part ii., book iv. page 521, Oxford, 1819,
8vo., states that when John Hampden and the four
other members of Parliament were accused of High
Treason, and were, by their own party, brought back
in triumph from the City, January the 11th, 1641-42,
‘from London-Bridge to Westminster, the Thames
was guarded with above a hundred lighters and longboats,
laden with small pieces of ordnance, and
dressed up with waistclothes and streamers, as ready
for fight,’ These forces, together with the City Trained-bands
under Major General Skippon, were not less to
honour, than to defend, the return of the accused
Members. The same noble Historian tells us farther,
in the same volume and part, book v. page 661, that
about the end of March in the same year, the Justices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and principal gentlemen of the County of Kent,
prepared a Petition to the two Houses of Parliament,
that the Militia might not be otherwise exercised in
that County than according to Law, and that the
Common Prayer Book might still be observed. This
was construed by the Parliament into a commotion in
Kent; the Earl of Bristol and Judge Mallet were
committed to the Tower only for having seen it;
and strong guards were placed at London Bridge,
where the petitioners approaching the City were disarmed,
and forced to return, and only a very few permitted
to proceed with the petition to Westminster.</p>

<p>“That it was the unhappy custom, even late in the
seventeenth century, to erect heads over the South
Gate on London Bridge, we have, Alas! too many
proofs; though, indeed, it seems to have been only the
case with such as were considered traitors, as were
those unfortunate Romish Priests executed under the
Statutes of Elizabeth and James I. When Bishop
Challoner is speaking, in his work already cited, volume
iii., page 112, of the death of Bartholomew Roe,
a Priest of the Order of St. Benedict, in January, 1642,
he states that, on the morning of his execution, he
exhorted the Catholics who were present at his Mass
in the prison, and desired them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span> ‘that as often as in
passing through the City, they should see that hand
of his fixed on one of the Gates, or in crossing the
water, should see his head on London Bridge, they
would remember those lessons which he had preached
to them, of the importance of holding fast the Catholic
faith, and of leading a Christian and holy
life.’ In October, 1642, the head of Thomas Bullaker,
a Priest of the Order of St. Francis, was also set up on
London Bridge. See Bishop Challoner, page 132, in
the same volume: and another unhappy instance of a
similar execution is to be found in Dr. Challoner’s
life of Henry Heath, a Father of the Order of St.
Francis, contained on pages 141, 143, of the same
volume of his work. Having left Douay and landed
in England, this Priest travelled to the metropolis in
the greatest poverty. ‘At London he arrives wearied,
as well he might, having travelled barefoot forty miles
that day, and it being the Winter season. It is now
time to take up his quarters, and give some little rest
and refreshment to the body. But how shall this be
done, for money he has none, nor acquaintance? however,
he ventures to call at the Star Inn, near London
Bridge, but the people of the house finding that he
had no money, turned him out of doors at eight
o’clock in a cold winter night.’ In this distress, he
laid down to rest at a Citizen’s door, where the owner
of the house had him seized for a shoplifter, and,
when examined by the watch, some writings in defence
of the Romish faith being found in his cap, he
owned himself to be a Priest. He was then tried and
convicted upon the Statute of Elizabeth, and was
executed on April the 17th, 1643, at Tyburn, and
his head erected upon London Bridge.</p>

<p>“On the 7th of March, 1642, the two Houses of
Parliament ordered that the City of London should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
be fortified, for its better security and safety; and on
the day following the order was printed, in small
quarto, a copy of which is in the King’s Collection of
Tracts in the British Museum, volume 97; and of
which, if I repeat you a portion of the title, you will
receive all the information contained in the pamphlet
itself. ‘<cite>An Ordinance and Declaration of the Lords
and Commons assembled in Parliament, that the Lord
Mayor and Citizens of the City of London, for the
better securing and safetie thereof, shall have full power
and authority, according to their discretion, to trench,
stop, and fortifie all high-waies leading into the said
City, as well within the Liberties, as without, as they
shall see cause. And for the better effecting thereof,
shall impose upon all the inhabitants within the same,
upon every house worth &pound;5. a year, six pence, and every
house of greater rent, after the rate of two pence in the
pound.</cite>’ Another copy of this ordinance was printed in
April, 1643, and is to be found in volume 104 of the
same collection. Maitland, in his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i.,
pages 368, 369, also mentions an act of Common
Council passed for the same purpose, February the
23rd, 1642-43: and gives a plan of the fortifications
erected round the City. It was enacted, says he, that
‘all the passages and ways leading to the City should
be shut up, excepting those entering at Charing Cross,
St. Giles’s in the Fields, St. John’s Street, Shoreditch,
and Whitechapel; and that the exterior ends of the
said streets should be fortified with breast-works and
turnpikes, musket-proof; and all the sheds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
buildings contiguous to London-Wall without, be
taken down; and that the City Wall, with its bulwarks,
be not only repaired and mounted with artillery,
but, likewise, that divers new works be added to
the same at places most exposed.’ When this act
had been confirmed by the above ordinances of Parliament,
the fortifications were commenced and carried
on with considerable rapidity; men, women, and
children, were employed upon the works; and, in a
short time, an earthern rampart, with redoubts, horn-works,
batteries, forts, and bulwarks, was erected
round the Cities of London and Westminster, and the
Borough of Southwark. We have no particular account,
however, of the manner in which London
Bridge was fortified at this period; and the great
events which took place in the history of the Civil
Wars seem to have swallowed up every circumstance
connected with this edifice. We learn, indeed, that in
the year 1647, the Parliamentary Army entered the
City, whilst the Corporation was engaged in an irresolute
debate as to the measures to be adopted for its
defence: when frequent conciliatory messages passed
between the chief Officers and London; and, the less
to alarm the Metropolis, the soldiers were quartered
at some distance from it. ‘However, in this calm,’&mdash;says
Lord Clarendon, who relates these circumstances
in his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume iii., part i., book x., page
104,&mdash;‘they sent over Colonel Rainsborough with a
brigade of horse, and foot, and cannon, at Hampton
Court, to possess Southwark, and those works which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
secured that end of London Bridge; which he did
with so little noise, that in one night’s march he
found himself master, without any opposition, not
only of the Borough of Southwark, but of all the
works and forts which were to defend it; the soldiers
within shaking hands with those without, and refusing
to obey their officers which were to command them:
so that the City, without knowing that any such thing
was in agitation, found in the morning that all that
avenue to the Town was possessed by the enemy;
whom they were providing to resist on the other side,
being as confident of this that they had lost, as of
any gate in the City.’</p>

<p>“Bulstrode Whitelock, in his ‘<cite>Memorials of the
English Affairs</cite>,’ London, 1732, folio, page 263,
enables us to add to this account, that on Colonel
Rainsborough’s advance to Southwark, he found the
Bridge gates shut, the Portcullis lowered, and a guard
within; but upon placing a counter-guard with two
pieces of ordnance, against the gate, in a short time
the great fort was surrendered; about two in the
morning of Monday, the 2nd of August, 1647.</p>

<p>“A curious invention, which, very probably, was
never carried into execution, was, in the year 1643,
connected with the history of London Bridge; being
the scheme of an unsuccessful engineer named Captain
John Bulmer. You may see an original copy of
his ‘<cite>Propositions in the Office of Assurance, London,
for the Blowing up of a Boat and a man over London
Bridge</cite>,’ in the King’s Collection of Tracts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
British Museum, Miscellaneous Pieces, volume 3*,
folio, article 88. In this statement, which consists of
a broadside of one page, he thus commences. ‘In
the name of God, Amen, John Bulmer, of London,
Esquire: Master and Surveiour Generall of the King’s
Maiestie’s Mines Royall, and Engines for Water-workes,
propoundeth&mdash;by God’s assistance,&mdash;that he,
the said John Bulmer, shall and will, at and in a
flowing water, set out a Boat or Vessell with an
Engine, floating with a man or a boy in and aboard
the said Boat, in the River of Thames, over against
the Tower-wharfe, or lower. Which said Boat, with
the said man or boy in or aboard her, shall the same
tide, before low-water againe, by art of the said John
Bulmer, and helpe of the said engine, be advanced
and elevated so high, as that the same shall passe and
be delivered over London Bridge, together with the
said man or boy in and aboard her, and floate againe
in the said River of Thames, on the other side of the
said Bridge, in safety.’ He then proceeds to covenant
for himself, his heirs, &amp;c., to perform this within the
space of one month, after he shall have intimated at
the Assurance Office that he is about to put it in
practice. This announcement was to be made ‘so
soone as the undertakers wagering against him six
for one,’ should have deposited in the Office such a
sum as he should consider sufficient to ‘countervaile
his charges of contriving the said Boat and Engine.’
Captain Bulmer was also to deposit his proportion of
the money, and the whole, being subscribed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
signed, was to remain in the office, until he had
either performed his contract, when he was to receive
it; or till his failure, when it was to be re-delivered
to the subscribers. This curious paper is dated November
the 6th, and concludes with the following
promise: ‘And all those that will bring in their
monies into the Office, shall be there assured of their
losse or gaine, according to the conditions above
mentioned.’ I imagine, however, that this scheme
met with but little or no encouragement, because I
find a new edition of it, dated March the 20th, 1647,
printed in small folio, and inserted in the King’s
Tracts marked ‘<cite>Single Sheets</cite>,’ volume 5, article 130.
It varies, however, somewhat from the foregoing, and
states that ‘the blowing up of a Gun from under the
water by the breath of a man’s mouth, shall occasion
the raising of such Boate or vessell; which said gun
shall then forthwith after be discharged by fire given
thereunto, and presently sinke againe: after the sinking
whereof, another gunne shall be raised by such
meanes as aforesaid, which shall be discharged also,
forthwith upon the floating of the said Boate or
Vessell on the other side of the sayd Bridge.’ He
no longer mentions his terms to be ‘six for one,’ but
states that his performance shall take place within a
month after the amount of his expenses shall be subscribed
by ‘persons pleasing to afford assistance and
furtherance to arts and mysteries of this nature.’ He
adds too, that security will be given at the office,
and that his reason for desiring these deposits is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
‘for that losse of time in collection of the same after
performance, would hinder him from prosecution of
businesse of greater consequence, and tending to the
publique good. He was, however, I doubt not, still
unsuccessful; for his time was not only one of national
poverty, arising from the Civil Wars, but it was
also one of projectors as forward and as promising as
himself: whilst the people, in general, seemed but
little disposed to encourage any new scheme, however
wonderful, and to be of the mind of Goldsmith’s
Scrivener, when he said, ‘For my part, I believe all
the money is gone to the Devil, or beyond the seas,
and he who has a little is a fool if he don’t keep it to
himself.’ The Captain, notwithstanding, seems to
have made another effort in November, 1649, in the
form of a small folio sheet, entitled ‘<cite>A note of such
Arts and Mysteries as an English Gentleman, a Souldier,
and a Traveller, is able, by God’s assistance, to perform;
he having means to perfect the same</cite>;’ of which
there is also a copy in the King’s Tracts, marked
‘<cite>Single Sheets</cite>,’ volume 8, Article 90. It consists of
five propositions concerning Mines, Warlike Engines,
Draining and raising water, and Machines for recovering
goods from the sea: which secrets he states
himself to have discovered ‘with much study, travell,
and expenses of many thousands of pounds;’ and
that now ‘being old and out of employment, he is
willing to shew his art in these things to any which
are desirous to learn, upon assurance of such reward
as they shall agree upon.’ To this is added a certificate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
of his ability to perform several of his projects,
from Emanuel College, Cambridge, dated 1646; and
the paper concludes by a copy of most lamentable
verses vindicating himself from his detractors.</p>

<p>“In February, 1644-45, the head of Henry Morse,
a Priest of the Society of Jesus, was set up on
London Bridge. See Bishop Challoner’s ‘<cite>Martyrology</cite>,’
volume iii., page 164.</p>

<p>“The manuscript Survey of Bridge Lands which I
have already mentioned, bears a memorandum that it
was lent in 1653; and it commences with a regulation,
which, from its language and orthography, appears to
have been made much before that period, relating to
an officer called the <cite>Sheuteman</cite>, who was, probably, an
overseer of the Bridge works, and watched the cataracts
or falls in the arches. The article is entitled
‘<cite>An Order taken and made for the Sheuteman, by us
Symond Ryse, and William Campion, Wardens of
London Bridge</cite>;’ and in substance it is nearly as
follows. ‘For as much as diuerse and sundry nights
the Sheuteman hath occasyon to ryse in the night-seison
to come to his boots, (boats) to see the tydes
as they fall erly or late for the occupations of the
Bridgehouse, so that the Porter muste open him the
gate at vn due tymes of the night, contrary to the
ordinances made for the same; whiche is not onely to
his greate payne and daunger, but also to the great
perell and daunger that myght fall to the house; for,
when the gates be opened at ded tymes of the night,
it is to be doutyd that some lewed persons myght<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
entre in after them, and not onely robbe thys house,
but also putt in daungre of their liues so many as be
within. For Remedye whereof, we, the said Wardene,
have ordeyned and appoynted a lodging to be made
att the ende of the Crane Howse, within the Bridge-howse
Yarde, with a chemnye in the same lodging,
and sufficient for two or three persons to lye in yt;
to the entente that the Sheuteman, with such persons
as of consequence he moste have with him for causes
requysyte for the tydes, may lye there drye, and
tarye theyre tydes when theye fall in the nyght, very
erly or late, hauing business to do for the howse;
and also when they come from theyre labour weete,
or att vn due tymes of the nyght, to goo home to
theire houses, may tarye there, and make them fyre to
drye them and keepe them warme, of such chyppes as
ys hughed of the timber in the yerd, and none other,
and nott to keepe any hospitalitie, or dwelling there at
ony tyme, but att such tyme and tymes afore rehersed.
And according to the old vse and custome, that when
the Sheuteman by daye tyme be not occupyed with
the boats about the affairs of the Bridge workes, that
then he is to doe all such workes within the Bridge-house
yerde and in all other places as other laborers
doeth, and so he is to receyue his wages, or els not.
And this ordinance to be alwayes kept.’</p>

<p>“In the year 1657, James Howel published his
volume entitled ‘<cite>Londinopolis; an Historicall Discourse,
or Perlustration of the City of London</cite>,’ to
which he attached some Latin verses in praise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
London Bridge, on the leaf immediately following the
title-page. They are entitled in Latin, ‘<cite>Concerning
London Bridge, and the stupendous site and structure
thereof, in imitation of those celebrated six verses of the
Poet Sannazarius, on the City of Venice, commencing
‘Viderat Hadriacis.</cite>’ This beautiful hexastichon is to
be found in that old and fair edition of his Latin
Poems printed at the Aldine Press, Venice, 1535,
8vo., in the first book of Epigrams, page 38&#8201;b, and it
is entitled ‘<cite>On the Wonders of the City of Venice</cite>.’
Now, that you may have some slight idea of the original
of Howel’s rhymes, before I recite them, perhaps
you will permit me to repeat to you an English
paraphrase of Sannazario’s <em>own</em> verses, fairly composed
in the Sonnet stanza, but not possessing the
elegant conciseness of the Latin?”</p>

<p>“Pray, go on, Sir,” answered I, with a good deal
of satirical ceremony in my voice; “Pray go on, Mr.
Barnaby; it’s long since I have had any choice as to
what you shall put in, or what you shall leave out, of
your discourse; and, therefore, let’s have the Sonnet,
such as it is: you know the proverb,&mdash;in for a penny,
in for a pound.”</p>

<p>“A facetious gentleman, truly,” was the Antiquary’s
reply; “but let me observe for your consolation,
Master Geoffrey, that we are now rapidly passing
through the history of the Bridge, and that on later
events I shall frequently have but little information to
impart. However, to return to the matter in hand,&mdash;this
is the Sonnet.</p>

<span class="i2">In the fair Adriatic Venice stand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A City, o’er its waters to command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed in rule o’er all its billowy caves!<br /></span>

<p>“This is truly somewhat ‘in Ercles’ vein,’” continued
the old gentleman, as he finished the Sonnet;
“but I think you will agree with me that it is completely
‘out-heroded’ by Howel’s imitation of it; as,
indeed, his Latinity is vastly inferior to Sannazario’s.
I really cannot imagine, how some have supposed
that Howel’s Latin verses were written by the Italian;
but this grievous mistake has been made, in consequence,
perhaps, of the words ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad instar</i>,’&mdash;after

<p>“I cannot imagine, Mr. Barbican, why the ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Londinopolis</cite>,’
in which these verses are printed, should
ever be quoted in preference to Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ from
which it is little more than a transcript, as Howel
himself acknowledges in his Advertisement. I should
mention, however, that it contains two fine prints, for
which it is, perhaps, chiefly desirable: one consisting
of a very spirited whole-length portrait of the author,
resting against a tree, and executed in that singular
style for which Claude Mellan was so famous; and
the other an interesting half-sheet etching by Hollar, of
London, before the Great Fire. With these embellishments,
and its own popularity, the volume sells
for about &pound;1. 11<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; but a fine impression of the
latter engraving alone will produce the sum of
10<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> From this work, then, at page 22, we learn
that the destruction occasioned by the ‘most raging
dismal fire’ of 1633, was not wholly repaired at the
time of its publication; for, after stating that it consumed
a third part of the buildings on the Bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
it is added, ‘by the commendable care of the City,
there are other goodly structures rais’d up in some of
their rooms, of a stronger, and more stately way of
building; and pity it is, that the work were not compleated,
there being no object,&mdash;after the Church of
St. Paul,&mdash;that can conduce more to the glory and
ornament of this renowned City.’ Yet, notwithstanding
this Author’s praises of ‘the Bridge of the
World,’ as he calls it, on page 20, he makes us acquainted
with what may be considered as an ancient
satire upon it; since he says, ‘<em>If London Bridge
had fewer eyes, it would see far better</em>.’ The arches
of this edifice, and the dangerous passage through
them, have also given rise to another quaint saying,
which is recorded in the Rev. J. Ray’s ‘<cite>Compleat Collection
of English Proverbs</cite>,’ London, 1737, octavo,
pages 13 and 251, and which is, ‘London Bridge
was made for wise men to go over, and fools to go
under.’</p>

<p>“On Tuesday, the 29th of May, 1660, King
Charles the Second entered London in triumph, after
having been magnificently entertained in St. George’s
Fields. About three in the afternoon he arrived in
Southwark, and thence proceeded over the Bridge
into the City, attended by all the glory of London,
and the military forces of the kingdom. Lord Clarendon,
who makes this ‘fair return of banished
Majesty’ the concluding scene of his noble History,
gives us but little information as to the King’s
reception at London Bridge, though we learn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
him that ‘the crowd was so great, that the King
rode in a crowd from the Bridge to Whitehall; all
the Companies of the City standing in order on both
sides, and giving loud thanks to God for his Majesty’s
presence. ‘All the streets’&mdash;says White Kennet,
Bishop of Peterborough, in his ‘<cite>Historical Register
of English Affairs</cite>,’ London, 1744, folio, page 163,&mdash;‘were
richly adorned with tapestry, from London
Bridge to Whitehall;’ and beyond Temple-bar, were
lined with the Trained bands, and a troop of the late
King’s Officers, headed by the loyal Sir John Stawell.
The procession, which was chiefly an equestrian one,
was begun by Major-General Brown, and 300 Citizens
in cloth of silver doublets; who were followed by
1200 more all in velvet, with footmen and liveries in
purple. Alderman Robinson then led other parties
habited in buff coats with sleeves of silver tissue, and
green silk scarfs; some in blue liveries with silver
lace; and footmen and trumpeters in sea-green, grey,
and silver liveries. Eighty of the Sheriffs’ followers
attended in red cloaks lined with silver, holding half-pikes;
and 600 of the City Companies rode in black
velvet coats and gold chains, with their respective
servitors in cassocks and ribbands. Drums, trumpets,
streamers, and the Life-guards, in satin, scarlet, and
silver, followed; then came the City Marshal, with
8 footmen in French green, trimmed with crimson
and white; whilst the City Waits and Officers, the
Sheriffs, the Aldermen, and their attendants, blazed
in red, and cloths of gold and silver in the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
rank. Heralds and Maces, in their splendid habits,
preceded Sir Thomas Allen, the Lord Mayor; who,
to gratify the City, was permitted to carry the Sword
of London immediately before the King, which had
not been done in any former public entry, excepting
when Charles I. returned from Scotland in 1641, and
even then the Sword of State had the precedence.</p>

<p>“I have next to mention a very rare and curious
pamphlet, never yet cited in the history of London
Bridge, of a Vision seen upon that edifice in March,
1661. It is contained in Article 6, No. 867, of that
invaluable collection of Tracts which the late King
presented to the British Museum. Like most of the
wonderful pamphlets of the seventeenth century, its
title is truly astounding, but the book itself is only a
small quarto of four leaves; of which, as all that
now concerns us is contained in three pages, I shall
give you the whole, and first for the magnificent
Title-page.</p>

<cite>manner how they all vanished. London, Printed for
J. Jones, 1661.</cite>’ Such is the entry into this exhibition
of wonders; the tract itself commences thus.</p>

<p>“‘An exact relation of severall strange wonders,
that were seen on Thursday last, by several persons
then on London Bridge, appearing in the West of
England.&mdash;Apparent hath been many signs and
wonders made to us here in England, whereby the
incredulous have been convinc’d of their obstinacy.
It being a great question, and doubtfull now with
the generality of people, whether those things lately
published which appeared in foreign parts were feasible
or no, they have since been verified by other
credible persons from those parts, to the great satisfaction
of some hundreds: therefore I shall forbear
mentioning them, and give you an exact account of
what hath lately been visible to divers persons now
resident in the City of London, which was as followeth,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr></i></p>

<p>“‘Upon the 21 day of March, about, or between
7 and 8 of the clock at night, divers persons living in
the City&mdash;as they came over London Bridge,&mdash;discovered
several clouds in strange shapes, at which
they suddenly made a stand, to see what might be the
event of so miraculous a change in the motion of the
Heavens. The first cloud seemed to turn into the
form or shape of a Cathedral, with a Tower advancing
from the middle of it upwards, which continued for
a small space and then vanished away. Another
turned into a tree, spreading itself like an oak,&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
near as could be judged,&mdash;which, in a short space,
vanished. Between these two was, as it were, standing,
a great mountain, which continued in the same form
near a quarter of an hour; after which, the mountain
still remaining, there appeared several strange shapes
one after another, issuing out of the said mountain,
about the middle of the right side thereof: the first
seemed to be formed like a Crokedile, with his mouth
wide open; this continued a very short space, and,
by degrees, was transformed into the form of a furious
Bull; and, not long after, it was changed into
the form of a Lyon; but it continued so a short time,
and was altered into a Bear, and, soon after, into a
Hog, or Boar, as near as those could guess who were
spectators. After all these shapes had appeared, the
mountain seemed to be divided and altered into the
form of two monstrous beasts, fastened together by
the hinder parts, drawing one apart from the other:
that which appeared on the left hand, resembled an
Elephant with a castle upon his back; that upon the
right hand, we could not so well determine, but it
seemed to us like a Lyon or some such like beast.</p>

<p>“‘The Castle on the back of the Elephant vanished,
the Elephant himself loosing his shape; and,
where the Castle stood, there rose up a small number
of men, as we judged, about some four or six: these
were in continual motion. The other beast, which
was beheld on the right hand, seemed to be altered
into the form of an Horse, with a rider on his back,
and, after a small proportion of time, the whole vanished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
falling downward. Then arose another great
cloud, and in small time it formed it selfe into the
likenesse of the head of a great Whale, the mouth of
which stood wide open. After this, at some distance
on the right hand, appeared a cloud, which became
like unto a head, or cap, with a horn, or ear, on each
side thereof, which was of very considerable length.
Between these two rose a few men, who moved up
and down with a swift motion; and immediately
after they all vanished except one man, who still continued
moving up and down with much state and
majesty. In the mean time arose near adjacent unto
this head, or cap, another cloud, out of which cloud
issued forth an Army, or great body of men; and
upon the left hand, arose another Army, each of
which marched one towards the other; about this time
the single man vanished away,&mdash;and the two Armies
seemed to approach very near each other, and encounter,
maintaining a combat one against the other,
and, after a short contest, all vanished. During all
this time there seemed, to our best apprehension, a
flame of fire along the Strand, towards the City of
London.’ Such is the notice of these ‘strange sights,’
as they are truly called; but, though I do not cite
them, the remaining two pages of the pamphlet are
filled with an account of some much stranger seen in
Hamburgh, in the preceding February: and now
that I have finished, Mr. Barbican, pray what do you
think of it?”</p>

<p>“What do I think of it?” returned I: “Why, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
<em>Captain Ironside</em> says in the Play, ‘that it’s a lie, to
be sure!’ You very well know, Mr. Postern, that a
great part of the seventeenth century was quite an
age for seeing wonders in the air: for they were continually
being exhibited to all sorts and conditions of
men; whilst, ever and anon, came forth a pamphlet full
of marvel and trumpery, detailing the last revelation,
occasionally ornamented ‘with a type of the vision
curiously engraven on copper.’ You may remember
how the Author of ‘<cite>The History of the Great Plague</cite>,’
tells you that he was in some danger from a crowd in
St. Giles’s, because he could not discern an Angel in
the air holding a drawn sword in his hand. Believe
me, good Mr. Barnaby, such visions are extremely
rare; and, when they <em>do</em> appear, they come not in the
uncertain forms of that which you have now referred
to. Minds of more weakness than piety gave a ready
faith to them, and in convulsed or sorrowful times,
were often hearing voices which spake not, and seeing
signs which were never visible: willing to deceive,
or be deceived, they saw, like <em>Polonius</em>, clouds
‘backed like an ousel,’ or, ‘very like a whale;’</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘So hypochondriac fancies represent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ships, Armies, Battles, in the firmament;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till steadier eyes the exhalations solve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all to its first matter, clouds, resolve!’”</span>
</div></div>

<p>“Truly, Mr. Barbican,” answered the Antiquary,
as I concluded, “truly, Sir, I should never have divined
that you had any dislike to dull reflections, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
you not yourself assured me so; but now if you will
pledge me in another draught of sack, I’ll furnish
you with a new scene of London Bridge, from the
pencil of an eminent foreigner, as it appeared in
May, 1663. This is selected from the very amusing
‘<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyages de Mons. de Monconys</cite>,’ and the best edition
of his book is that bearing the imprint of Paris, though
it was in reality published at Lyons, in 1695, duodecimo.
In the second volume of this work, and on
page 14 of the part relating to England, he thus
speaks of London Bridge. ‘After having passed this
place,’&mdash;that is Greenwich, which the Author calls
<em>Grenuche</em>,&mdash;‘we soon came to London, of which the
length is truly incredible; but more than two thirds
of the River sides are occupied by warehouses and
very small buildings of wood, even upon the Bridge,
at the foot of which, on the City side, is a large edifice
erected wholly of wood, without any iron, which seems
to be of hewn stone it is so regularly built. At the other
extremity of the Bridge, above the towers of a castle,
are many of the heads of the murderers of King Charles.’
On page 21, M. Monconys is speaking of the ‘<em>bots</em>’&mdash;boats,&mdash;which
formerly plied on the Thames to carry
persons to the City, or Westminster, by way of avoiding
the rude English coaches, and the ruder paved
streets of London: ‘They never,’ says he, ‘go below
the Bridge; although there is not any place to which
they cannot be had, but it is considered dangerous
for these small boats to go under the Bridge when
the tide is running up, for the water has then an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
extreme rapidity, even greater than when it is returning,
and the two currents are united.’ On
page 121, in mentioning his visit to the Tower, he
states that neither in going nor returning did his
boat pass under the Bridge; for the tide being running
up, there was a fall of more than two feet. The
passengers left the boat, crossed to the other side of
the Bridge, and then re-entered it: whilst the watermen,
he adds, had no difficulty in descending the fall,
but a great deal in mounting up it again.</p>

<p>“It has been reported, that during the awful time
when London was being devastated by the terrible
Plague of 1665, the inhabitants of the Bridge were
free from its ravages; which is attributed to the
ceaseless rushing of the river beneath it. I have not
yet discovered, however, the least foundation for such
a tradition in any of the numerous publications which
appeared concerning the pestilence; and, indeed, the
only place in which I find this edifice at all mentioned,
is in that terrible volume attributed to Daniel Defoe,
and called ‘<cite>A Journal of the Plague Year, by a Citizen
who continued all the while in London</cite>;’ London, 1722,
octavo, where, on page 255, when speaking of the
fires made in the streets for clearing the air after the
pestilence, he says, ‘I do not remember whether any
was at the City gates, but one at the Bridge foot
there was, just by St. Magnus’ Church.’</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, that in
the fearful conflagration of London, which occurred
between the night of Saturday and the morning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
Sunday, the 2nd of September, 1666, the Bridge suffered
in any proportion to the rest of the City; for I
have already shewn you, from Strype’s Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
that some of the original houses of King John’s time,
were subsequently standing at the Southwark end. I
attribute this preservation to the vacancy opposed to
the flames at the North end of the Bridge; but as the
fire forms so memorable an epoch in the history of
London, I shall bring before you some evidence concerning
its actual effect upon this building. ‘’Twas at
still midnight,’ says one of the most particular accounts
of it extant, ‘when all was wrapt in a peaceful silence,
and every eye shut up in quiet slumber, that this
dreadfull fire brake forth, whose hidden flames at first
obscurely crept within close limits; but quickly
scorning to be so confined, in a bright blaze brake
openly upon us. And now the voice of fire in every
street&mdash;with horrid emphasis,&mdash;is echoed forth: these
dreadfull screems disturb our midnight quiet, and
raise affrighted people from their beds, who, scarce
awake, all seems to be a dream. Each one appears
but as a moving statue, as once Lot’s wife, viewing
her flaming Sodom, transformed into a pillar: a
powerfull wind aided these raging flames, which, like
a growing foe, increaseth still.’ Such is the commencement
of a broadside, entitled ‘<cite>A Short Description
of the fatal and dreadfull Burning of London;
divided into every day and night’s progression. Composed
by Samuel Wiseman</cite>;’ but yet this most particular
sheet relates nothing concerning the Bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
We have, however, some little information in a narrative
written by Thomas Vincent,&mdash;a non-conformist
Minister, who was ejected from the living of St.
Mary Magdalen, in Milk-street;&mdash;and called ‘<cite>God’s
terrible Judgements in the City, by Plague and Fire</cite>.’
Now, says the Author, it ‘rusheth down the hill
towards the Bridge; crosseth Thames-street, invadeth
St. Magnus’ Church at the Bridge-foot; and, though
that Church were so great, yet it was not a sufficient
barricado against this Conqueror; but, having scaled
and taken this fort, it shooteth flames with so much
the greater advantage into all places round about;
and a great building of houses upon the Bridge is
quickly thrown to the ground: then the conqueror,
<em>being stayed in his course at the Bridge</em>, marcheth back
to the City again, and runs along with great noise and
violence through Thames-street, Westward.’ The minute
and pathetic narrative of the accomplished John
Evelyn, adds nothing to these particulars; for he
says only in his ‘<cite>Diary</cite>,’ edit. 1818, volume i., page
375, on September the 7th, upon the destruction of
certain houses erected about the Tower, if they had
‘taken fire and attacked the White Tower, where the
magazine of powder lay, they would undoubtedly not
only have beaten and destroyed all y<sup>e</sup> Bridge, but
sunke and torne the vessells in y<sup>e</sup> River.’ The report
of Samuel Pepys, in his ‘<cite>Diary</cite>,’ already quoted,
does not give us much additional information; though
he tells us in volume i., page 445, that on the morning
of the 2nd, he went on the Tower battlements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
whence he saw ‘the houses at that end of the Bridge
all on fire; and an infinite great fire on this and the
other side the end of the Bridge, which, with other
people, did trouble me for poor little Michell and our
Sarah on the Bridge.’ He subsequently adds that the
fire increased on both sides the North end of London
Bridge, but there is nothing said farther concerning
its attack upon the edifice itself.</p>

<div>
<p>“There are several prospects of this dreadful conflagration,
though few of them are worthy of any
credit, most having been executed in Holland; and it
is probable, indeed, that the best was a small and
spirited etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, measuring
7 inches by 2&frac34;, and inserted on the right hand side of
‘<cite>A New and Exact Map of Great Britaine. Published
by John Overton, at the White Horse, without
Newgate</cite>. 1667.’ Single sheet. This view is taken
from Hollar’s old observatory, the tower of St. Mary
Overies Church; and represents the fire spreading
furiously Westward, whilst the Bridge appears untouched.
This fine little print you will find to be
the first illustration in volume ii. of Mr. Crowle’s
Pennant in the Print Room of the British Museum;
and it is entitled ‘<cite>Prospect of the Citty of London, as it
appeared in the time of its flames</cite>:’ it has frequently
sold for 10<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, and sometimes for 15<em>s.</em>, even without
the plate it belongs to. Hollar’s long view of the
City immediately after the conflagration, I have already
mentioned; and in that we see with much
more certainty the actual damage sustained by our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
unhappy old edifice, in the <span class="smcap">Ruins of the Riverside

<p>“The alteration appears chiefly to consist in the destruction
of that large square building, which terminated
the Northern end of the Bridge; and, of course,
the entire demolition of the wooden pales and passage,
which had been erected after the fire of 1633; but
beyond this the flames do not seem to have penetrated.
The banks of the River, indeed, presented a
more entire picture of ruin. Of the grand Church of
St. Magnus nothing remained but some of the walls,
and the buildings in front of it were destroyed even
to the water’s edge; whilst on the Western side of
the Bridge, the Water-works and Tower, numerous
houses lining the River, and the ancient edifice of
Fishmongers’ Hall, were reduced either to smouldering
fragments, scarcely bearing even the forms of
what they once had been, or else had not one stone left
upon another. ‘<cite>The Long Antwerp View of London</cite>,’
which has been already so minutely described, furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
us with a good representation of <span class="smcap">Fishmongers’
Hall before the Fire of 1666</span>;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">

</div>

<p class="pc">and it appears to have been a plain narrow edifice,
castellated and covered with lead on the top, having
two principal stories, the lower one of which had a
kind of gallery or balcony, an ornament which was
very common to buildings in this part of London.
The Companies of the Salt-fish and Stock-fish mongers
were anciently possessed of so many as six Halls; of
which two stood in New Fish-street, now called
Fish-street Hill; two more were in Old Fish-street,
and two others were erected in Thames-street; in
each place one for each Company. These, however,
were all united in the year 1536, the 28th of Henry
the Eighth; after which they were to have but one
Hall, namely, the house given to them by Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
Cornwall, afterwards created Baron Fanhope, in
1427, the 6th year of Henry VI., which I take to
have been the building represented in the print;
since Stow, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 499, from
whom we derive these few particulars, says that it was
in the Parish of St. Michael, Crooked Lane: and adds
on the preceding page, that ‘Fishmongers’ Hall, with
other fair houses for merchants, standeth about midway
between the Bridge foot and Ebgate, or Old Swan-lane.’
Still more brief, however, are the notices, which
he furnishes us concerning the Company’s other Halls,
which once stood about the same spot. ‘On the West
side of this Ward,’&mdash;says the old Citizen,&mdash;‘at the
North end of London Bridge, is a part of Thames-street,
which is also of this Ward, to wit, so much as
of old time was called Stock-Fishmonger Row,’&mdash;a
place, you will remember, referred to in that manuscript
Survey of Bridge lands which I some time
since recited to you&mdash;‘of the Stock-fishmongers
dwelling there, down West to a Water-gate, of old
time called Ebgate, since Ebgate Lane, and now the
Old Swan.’ I will not enter into the history of the
Fishmongers’ Company, Mr. Barbican, because it
does not belong to our present subject, and you may
read the chief particulars for yourself, in Stow’s
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 498, and volume ii., page
268; and shall therefore only add a very few particulars
concerning the present Hall. According to the
splendid plan of Sir Christopher Wren, for adorning
the banks of the Thames, it presents to the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
a handsome, though somewhat old-fashioned front of
red brick, having the windows ornamented with stone
cases. From the wharf on which the Shades’ Tavern
is situate, a grand double flight of stone steps leads to
the chief apartments; and the door is decorated with
Ionic columns supporting an open pediment, containing
a shield with the Company’s Arms, all of stone.
I shall say nothing, however, of the handsome North
front of this building, its spacious court-yard, and its
beautiful carved gateway in Thames-street; nor yet
of the rich state chambers, their fine paintings of
fish, their massive and richly-chased silver branches,
their large brazen chandeliers, the interesting relique
of Sir William Walworth, nor of the interior of the
spacious Hall. I will tell you nothing of either of
these, Mr. Geoffrey, since they cannot be observed
from London Bridge; but before I entirely quit the
Fishmongers, let me observe that Strype, in his Fifth
Book of Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ has two very singular
notices concerning them, which I do not remember to
have seen mentioned in any historical account of
yonder passage across the Thames. They consist of
certain ancient statutes peculiar to this Company,
taken from the record called ‘<cite>Horn</cite>,’ in the Chamber
of London; and they state that it should be prohibited
that any Fishmonger should ‘buy a fresh fish
before Mass at the Chapel upon the Bridge be celebrated:’
which Chapel, it is elsewhere stated, is one
of the bounds, beyond which no Fishmonger ought
to go to buy fish.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have already observed that Hollar’s View of
London after the Fire, shews the fine old Church of
St. Magnus, which we may consider the North-East
boundary of London Bridge, reduced to a pile of
ruined walls; having all those costly repairs and
beautifyings, which Stow, in his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i.,
page 494, records as having taken place from 1623 to
1629, destroyed in the flames. Before I speak, however,
of the re-edification of this fane, I shall notice
the means employed for that of the Bridge itself, as
they are related by the continuators of Stow in his
‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 62. Most of the buildings
erected upon it, were, as they tell us, totally consumed;
excepting the Chapel, and a few edifices
standing on the South end, of the time of King John:
though this, as I have shewn you, must be erroneous.
We may believe, however, from all the circumstances
attendant upon the fire, that the stone-work
of the Bridge was so battered and weakened, ‘that it
cost the Bridge-House &pound;1500. to make good the damage
in the piers and arches, before the leaseholders
could attempt to rebuild the premises destroyed by the
fire.’ Though ‘the stone work,’ continues this passage,
‘was no sooner secured, than a sufficient number of
tenants offered; who conditioned with the Bridge-House
for building-leases of 61 years, at the rate of
10<em>s.</em> per foot, running, yearly, and to build after such
a form and substantial manner as was prescribed.’
This was so rapidly carried into effect, that in five
years the North end was all completely finished, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
houses four stories high, and a street of 20 feet in
breadth between them, measuring from side to side.
To make the South end equally perfect, however, and,
at the same time, to equalize the rent of the whole, required
the invention of some expedient; since the older
buildings were already leased to several tenants, with
longer and shorter portions of their time yet to elapse,
whilst the leases of others were entirely expired. To
arrange all these with propriety, the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and Commonalty, who were appointed for
the letting of the Bridge-House lands, with the assistance
of Mr. Philip Odde, then Clerk Comptroller
of those estates, took the following method. For the
first class of tenants, they measured the number of
feet in the front of each house; and ascertained the
amount of rent, and the time of the lease yet unexpired:
whilst a second and third classes were formed
of those whose leases were nearly out, or entirely
finished. To such as had the longest term to run, a
moderate time was added, with an abatement of rent
answerable to the cost of re-erecting their buildings,
in uniformity with those at the North end. Of the
tenants whose leases were nearly expired, and who
were unable to build, they were redeemed for valuable
considerations; the dilapidated stone-work for
the new buildings was then repaired by the City, at
an expense of nearly &pound;1000; and in about four or
five years the whole edifice was completed.</p>

<p>“We are not, however, now informed of any repair
of the Draw-Bridge, although it certainly existed until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
the great alteration of 1758; but, probably, even long
before <em>this</em> time, had ceased to be of any great utility.
You may see, in Stow’s historical notices of Queenhithe,
(vide his ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., pages 697-700,)
that in the reign of King Henry III. ships and boats
laden with corn and fish for sale, were compelled to
pass <em>beyond</em> the Bridge to that most ancient wharf
and market. In 1463, however, the third year of
King Edward IV., the same authority informs us that
the market at Queenhithe was ‘hindered by reason of
the slackness of drawing up of London Bridge,’ which
seems to infer some difficulty in raising it even at that
period; fresh ordinances being then made to cause
vessels with provisions to proceed up the river. I cannot,
however, tell you at what time the Draw-Bridge
was made wholly stationary; though it seems not to
have been till <em>after</em> the publication of the last ancient
edition of Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ in 1633, folio, as, in Strype’s
excellent new one, of 1720, volume i., book i., page 58,
he adds some notices of the arches, in which occurs
the following passage. ‘Two of these arches are
much larger than the rest, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr></i> that over which is the
Draw-bridge; and the other called <em>the Simile Lock</em>.
These were for the use of greater vessels that went
through Bridge Westward. The Draw-Bridge formerly
was, upon such occasions, taken up; but now-a-days
never, but when it wants repairing.’ The
additions of Richard Bloome also, on page 56 in the
same volume, furnish us with several particulars of
these arches, which I shall introduce to you in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
place, because they apply, almost equally, both to the
Bridge before the Fire, and to the ancient appearance
of the present one. ‘There were,’ says he, ‘three
vacancies, with stone walls, and iron grates,’&mdash;rather
rails,&mdash;‘over them, on either side, opposite to each
other; through which grates, people, as they pass over
the Bridge, may take a view of the river both East
and West; and also may go aside, more to each side,
out of the way of carts and coaches, the passage
being but narrow, and not only troublesome but dangerous.
These three vacancies are over three of the
middle arches, for all the piers are not of a like
thickness, nor stand at equal distance one from the
other; for under those three vacancies are much
wider than the rest, and are called the navigable
locks, because vessels of considerable burthen may
pass through them. One of these is near unto the
second gate, and is called the Rock Lock. The second
is under the second vacancy, and is called the <em>Draw-Bridge
Lock</em>. And the third is near the Chapel, and
is called <em>St. Mary’s Lock</em>. There is a fourth between
St. Magnus’ Church and the first vacancy, and is
called the <em>King’s Lock</em>, for that the King in his
passage through Bridge, in his barge, goes through
this lock.’ In Strype’s additions to these particulars,
which I have already referred to, he says, ‘The two
Arches next London are now stopped up for the use
of the Water-mills, but without any prejudice to the
current of the Thames. The third arch on the Southwark
side is seldom, and very rarely, passed through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
because of a rock grown there a little to the East,
which is visible at low water. This rock hath been
observed this many a year, and is called the <em>Rock
Lock</em>. The reparation of these arches, and the
striking down piles for securing them, is continual,
and men are kept on purpose to take care of it, and
to do it. Whereof they have two Master-workmen,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr></i> a Head-Carpenter,’&mdash;whose name in Strype’s
time was Wise,&mdash;‘and a Head-Mason, whose office it
is to look after the Bridge under the Bridge-Masters.’
The common report of the rock growing beneath
the water, under one of the Arches of London Bridge,
is, however, one of those popular traditions which
are generally to be found connected with almost every
edifice, engendered partly by ignorance, and partly
by the desire mentioned by the Indian in Robinson
Crusoe, ‘To make the great wonder look!’ ‘We have
been assured,’ says the Rev. John Motley, in ‘<cite>Seymour’s
Survey of London</cite>,’ volume i. page 48, ‘by a
person of great veracity as well as curiosity, that a
friend of his in the year 1715, when the tide was so
kept back that many people walked over the river,
went near enough to examine this, and found it to be
stones joined together with cement, and iron in some
places; and therefore supposed it was part of an arch
that had formerly been broken down, and never since
removed,’ It has been generally believed, that these
ruins were the fragments of the two arches, and the
Bridge-gate, which, as I have related to you, fell
down in the year 1437: and which, having now lain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
nearly four centuries, and been increased by the deposits
which millions of tides have cast upon them,
have become almost as impenetrable as a solid rock,
and the arch, therefore, retains its ancient name.
Such was London Bridge after it was rebuilt, ‘peopled’&mdash;as
Evelyn says of the City, but a very few days
after the fire,&mdash;‘with new shops, noise, and business,
not to say vanity.’&mdash;‘A Bridge,’ exclaims Richard
Bloome, in his continuations to Stow, volume i.
page 499, ‘not inferior to any in Europe for its
length, breadth, and buildings thereon, being sustained
by nineteen great stone arches, secured by
piles of timber drove to the bottom of the river,
having a Draw-Bridge towards Southwark, as also
strong gates; and, by its houses built thereon on both
sides, it seemeth rather a street than a Bridge, being
now garnished with good timber buildings, which are
very well inhabited by sufficient tradesmen, who have
very considerable dealings, as being so great a thoroughfare
from Southwark into London.’</p>

<p>“Whilst I am mentioning this praise of London
Bridge, I may express my wonder that Michael
Drayton, in his ‘<cite>Poly-Olbion</cite>,’ London, 1613, folio,
says so little concerning it, whilst John Selden, in
his very learned notes to that poem, wholly omits it.
As I purpose next to say a few words touching the
rebuilding of St. Magnus’ Church, I will close this
part of our Bridge history by repeating Drayton’s
verses from Song xvii., page 259: where, speaking
of the Thames, he says,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>“Bloome, the continuator of Stow, to whose
labours we are in general little less indebted than we
are to those of the old historian himself, gives us but
few particulars concerning the rebuilding of St.
Magnus’ Church; stating only that it was erected of
free-stone, with ‘a tower and steeple of curious workmanship;
to which Church,’ he adds, ‘is united the
Parish of St. Margaret, New Fish-street, that Church
not being rebuilt.’ Newcourt, in his account of the
Rectory of St. Magnus, says likewise very little as to
its history; though he tells us, that when the Parishes
were united, the yearly value of them was made
&pound;170, whereas, in 1632, that of St. Magnus amounted
only to &pound;83, and that of St. Margaret to &pound;70: and
he states also, that part of their Church, before it was
rebuilt, was laid into the street, for enlarging the
passage. We have, however, a very fair though brief
description of the new Church of St. Magnus, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
‘<cite>Memoirs of the Life and Works of Sir Christopher
Wren</cite>,’ by James Elmes; London, 1823, quarto,
pages 357, 490; wherein he states that it was begun
in 1676, and that the lofty tower, lanthorn, cupola,
and spire, were added in 1705. It is then, as all may
see for themselves, an elegant and substantial Church,
built of stone and oak timber, covered with lead, and
crowned with a handsome lofty steeple, consisting of
a tower, a lanthorn containing ten bells, and a cupola
surmounted by a well-proportioned spire. The interior,
measuring 90 feet in length, 59 in breadth, and
41 in height, is divided into a nave and two aisles, by
columns, and an entablature of the Ionic Order;
whilst the roof, over the nave, is camerated, and enriched
with arches of fret work, executed in stucco.
For the monuments, epitaphs, and benefactors of this
Church, both ancient and modern, I must refer you to
Strype’s Stow, volume i., page 494; and will mention
only the gift of the clock by Sir Charles Duncomb,
in the year 1700, at the cost of &pound;485. 5<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> The
dial of this clock was formerly ornamented with
several richly gilded figures, which have since been
removed, but a view of the Church, before the archway
was opened,&mdash;of which we shall speak hereafter,&mdash;having
also the clock in its original state, will be
found in Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’ at my last reference, and in
Maitland’s ‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ volume ii., page 1124.
Tradition says, that it was erected in consequence of
a vow made by the donor, who, in the earlier part of
his life, had once to wait a considerable time in a cart
upon London Bridge, without being able to learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
hour, when he made a promise, that if he ever became
successful in the world, he would give to that Church
a public clock, and an hour-glass, that all passengers
might see the time of day. There is in ‘<cite>The Protestant
Mercury</cite>,’ of September the 11th, 1700, the
following rather curious mention of this clock: ‘On
Monday last, the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor,
accompanied by the worshipful Aldermen and Sheriffs,
went, with the usual formalities, to proclaim Southwark
fair; after which they were nobly entertained
at the Bridge House, according to an ancient annual
custom. In their passing by St. Magnus’ Church,
they were presented with the view of that noble and
magnificent Dial erected at the West end, at the
charge of the generous Sir Charles Duncomb, which
equalizing, if not exceeding, all others of that kind,
seems to answer the design of the donor.’ This donation
is also recorded upon the clock itself; for upon
a small metal plate, shaped like a shield, and silvered,
screwed to the interior, are engraven the giver’s arms,&mdash;a
chevron between three talbot’s heads erased,&mdash;with
the following inscription: ‘The Gift of Sir
Charles Duncomb, Knight, Lord Major, and Alderman
of this Ward. Langley Bradley fecit, 1709.’
The same liberal Citizen also presented the modern
fane of St. Magnus with an organ, of which the
‘<cite>Spectator</cite>’ of February the 8th, 1712, thus speaks:
‘Whereas Mr. Abraham Jordan, senior and junior,
have, with their own hands, joynery excepted, made
and erected a very large organ in St. Magnus’ Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
at the foot of London Bridge, consisting of four sets
of keys, one of which is adapted to the art of emitting
sounds by swelling notes, which never was in any
organ before; this instrument will be publicly opened
on Sunday next, the performance by Mr. John Robinson.
The above-said Abraham Jordan gives notice
to all masters and performers, that he will attend
every day next week at the said Church, to accommodate
all those gentlemen who shall have a curiosity
to hear it.’ I will conclude these notices by referring
you to Malcolm’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Londinum Redivivum</cite>,’
volume iv., pages 30-35, where you will find several
other particulars concerning St. Magnus.</p>

<p>“Upon the rebuilding of London, after the Great
Fire, it was the proposal of Sir Christopher Wren to
form a grand quay, or esplanade, from the foot of
London Bridge to the Temple; of which scheme
there is the fullest information, from an original manuscript,
in Mr. Elmes’s ‘<cite>Memoirs</cite>,’ pages 270 to 284,
<cite>Notes</cite>. It was proposed that the Quay should be 40
feet in width, between the Thames and the houses on
its banks; and, in the year 1670, a petition from the
inhabitants of this part of London was presented to
the Privy Council, stating that it would be of great detriment
to them if such way or wharf should not be
carried into effect, from London Bridge to Bridewell
Dock, the petitioners having commenced their several
houses near the Bridge, as well as the pipes and engines
of the Water-House. Of the ancient Water-House
at this place, I have already given you some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
idea; but I may observe, from the authority last cited,
that its supplies were constantly defiled by the public
drains, and other offensive buildings erected upon this
spot. Notwithstanding that the Commissioners of
Sewers had ordered their removal, and the King’s
Surveyor General had directed that no such contagious
places should be constructed here, even so
late as 1670 they had been again renewed, polluting
both the water and the passage across the Thames.
In consequence of the petition, Sir Christopher Wren,
assisted by the City Surveyors, inspected the whole
line of the intended wharf; and his report was:&mdash;That
the houses then begun to be built fronting the
Thames, which were not a third in number of what
the range would contain, were, in general, conformable
to the act, as to their being 40 feet distant from
the River, and that some of them towards the Bridge
were not ungraceful; but that others were unequally
low, and, as well as the warehouses, irregularly built;
whilst some habitations were constructed only of
board. The Quay between the row of houses and the
River, which should have been left open for passage,
was every where enclosed either with pales or brick
walls; and covered with stacks of timber, faggots,
and coals. The cranes erected West of the Bridge,
he states to be unhandsome, and larger than were required,
boarded down to the ground, and having
warehouses beneath them. The old towers of Baynard’s
Castle, he observes, were also still standing
upon the wharf; the walls, wharfings, and landing-stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
were, for the most part, unrepaired; and, in
some places, the Quay was likely to be broken by
bridges and docks. Sir Christopher’s report also
mentions numerous other obstacles, in consequence
of which, their immediate removal was ordered, and
the construction of the Quay directed, by an Act
of Parliament, in the 22nd of Charles II., 1670,
chapter 11, Sections xliv.-xlix.; as well as by a
Patent passed in the year following.</p>

<p>“The impediments to this design, however, were
never entirely removed; and, in modern times, their
number has considerably increased. Of these, Calvert’s
Brewery is one of the most prominent, which
is supposed to occupy the exact site of the mansion
anciently called Cold Harbour; where it now forms the
two sides of Champion-lane, formerly called Quay-Wharf-lane,
which, with All-hallows and Red-bull
lanes, was once open to the river. The last important
remains of Sir Christopher’s grand Civic esplanade
was shewn in a line of wharf 40 feet in width, and extending
from London Bridge to the Steelyard, entitled
New Quay; and it may be seen in the plans in Strype’s
‘<cite>Stow’s Survey</cite>,’ volume i., pages 486, 510; and in
Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume ii., pages 790, 1046.</p>

<div>
<p>“The Act of Parliament which I have recently
cited, also contains a very considerable portion of information
relative to the new buildings of London;
and from section liii. we learn, that the Water-House
at London Bridge was not renewed at the time of its
being passed, though in the Act for rebuilding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
London, passed in 1667, the 19th of Charles II.,
chapter 3, section xli., it is ordained: ‘that it shall
and may be lawful for the Water-House, called Mr.
Thomas Morris his Water-House, formerly adjoining
to London Bridge, to be rebuilt upon the place it
formerly stood, with timber, for the supplying the
South side of the City with water, as it for almost an
hundred years hath done.’ Most of the ancient engravings
of London Bridge, after the Fire, present us
with a view of this Water-House, by which it appears
that it was a lofty narrow wooden building, standing
close to the North West corner of the Bridge. On
its Western side, a flight of stairs led down to the
river; and its front looked on to the wooden stage
which supported the Water-works. Strype, in his
‘<cite>Stow’s Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 500, says, that ‘by
wheels, iron chains, &amp;c., it drinketh, or rather forceth
up water through leaden pipes to the top, where there
is a cistern, and from thence descendeth in other
leaden pipes to the bottom, and thence, received by
other pipes, is conveyed under the pavements of the
streets, and so serveth many families in this part of
the City with water; who have branches, or small
pipes, laid from the main ones unto their houses, to
their great convenience, and no small profit to the
City.’ In the very amusing ‘<cite>Voyages</cite>’ of Mons. Aubri
De la Motraye, Hague, 1727-32, folio, volume iii.,
pages 360-362, and plate iv., we have an engraving
of the interior mechanism of a public fire-engine
erected near this building, with an account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
means employed in it for raising of the water. One
of the most picturesque and interesting representations
of this modern <span class="smcap">Water-house</span> at <span class="smcap">London Bridge</span>,</p>

<p class="pc">is contained in a series of five views by S. and N.
Buck, which forms a sort of panoramic prospect of
London, from Westminster to below the Tower; each
being taken from a different point of observation.
They are dated September the 11th, 1749, and the
Bridge as it then appeared, covered with buildings,
forms a very prominent feature. I have to add only,
that you will find a set of these prints in volume xiii.
of Mr. Crowle’s Illustrated Pennant in the British
Museum.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>“Well, Master Barnaby,” said I, as well as I was
able for yawning, “though <em>you</em> can find no more to say
about this Water-House, I must add a few fragments
which would otherwise be lost; even as the song says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Mister Speaker, though ’tis late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>I</em> must lengthen the debate.’</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">I have been informed, upon the evidence of a very
ancient servant of the present London Bridge, that
the water rose in this Tower to the height of 128 feet,
through a pipe 12 inches in calibre, often bringing
very fine fish up with it; and that from beneath
the cistern at the top, issued nine main pipes which
supplied all London. As the particular direction of
each of these pipes was, of course, entirely different, in
the event of a fire, all of them were stopped excepting
the one which led immediately through that district;
and thus the whole weight of water was thrown
towards any place desired. From the same source,
I have also received a curious and very particular
drawing upon vellum, in colours, representing the
North end of London Bridge, the Water-House and
works, and the directions of the pipes issuing therefrom,
taken from actual measurement, and executed,
as I should suppose, before the fire by which they
were destroyed, on Sunday, October the 31st, 1779;
but this view shall be referred to hereafter. The
fire to which I have alluded, brake out in the warehouse
of Messrs. Judd and Sanderson, Hop Merchants,
at the foot of London Bridge, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
speedily communicated to the Water-works, in less
than an hour they were reduced nearly to a level with
the river. The wooden Water-Tower having been
pitched but a few days before, all the efforts of its
engines were, therefore, ineffectual. But enough of
water, Mr. Postern: what say you to another draught
of sack, and then another spell at the history of
London Bridge itself?”</p>

<p>“I like your motion mightily,” replied my companion,
“and, once more, here’s your health. In
speaking of the Great Fire of London, its consequences,
and the new buildings to which it gave birth,
I have brought forwards many fragments of our
Bridge annals, and anticipated several events, because
I wished to draw my information, as much as possible,
into one focus. We next pass to the year 1669,
though I should not mention to you the short notice
of London Bridge by Lorenzo Magalotti, which
occurs in ‘<cite>The Travels of Cosmo III., Grand Duke of
Tuscany, through England, during the reign of King
Charles II. 1669</cite>,’ London, 1821, quarto; but that it
affords something like a proof that the destruction
occasioned by the Fire of London was not extensive,
so far as it regarded this building, which by that time
seems to have been repaired. You will find the
passage at page 317, and it runs thus. ‘On the
morning of the 27th’&mdash;of May,&mdash;‘after hearing Mass,
his Highness went through the City as far as London
Bridge, on which are erected many large buildings,
almost half of which escaped the fire there; and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
which were consumed have been rebuilt of smaller
size, the upper part being used as dwellings, and the
lower part as Mercers’ shops, all of which are abundantly
filled with goods of various sorts. We crossed
the Bridge with some difficulty, owing to the number
of carts which are constantly passing and repassing.’
He then proceeds to speak of the Marshalsea, the
prisoners of which, he adds, have liberty to take a
walk over the Bridge, their promise being first taken
that they will not pass the limits, which they very
rarely infringe.</p>

<p>“Having mentioned to you, Mr. Geoffrey, several
famous Frosts which occurred in the earlier periods
of our history, I must not omit to notice that which
overspread the Thames from the beginning of December,
1683, until the 5th of February, 1684. ‘It
congealed the River Thames,’&mdash;says Maitland, in his
‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., page 484,&mdash;‘to that degree, that
another City, as it were, was erected thereon; where,
by the great number of streets, and shops, with their
rich furniture, it represented a great fair, with a variety
of carriages, and diversions of all sorts; and,
near Whitehall, a whole ox was roasted on the ice.’
Evelyn, however, who was an eye-witness of this scene,
furnishes the most extraordinary account of it in his
‘<cite>Diary</cite>,’ volume i., page 568; where, on January the
24th, 1684, he observes that ‘the frost continuing
more and more severe, the Thames before London
was still planted with boothes in formal streetes, all
sorts of trades and shops furnish’d, and full of commodities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
even to a printing-presse, where the people
and ladyes tooke a fancy to have their names printed,
and the day and yeare set down when printed on the
Thames: this humour tooke so universally, that ’twas
estimated the printer gain’d &pound;5. a day, for printing a
line onely, at sixpence a name, besides what he got by
ballads, &amp;c. Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other staires to and fro, as
in the streetes; sleds, sliding with skeetes, a bull-baiting,
horse and coach races, puppet-plays, and interludes,
cookes, tipling, and other lewd places, so
that it seem’d to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival
on the water.’”</p>

<p>“It is singular, Master Postern,” said I, as he finished
this extract, “that the author whom you have
now quoted, never once mentions that King Charles
the Second visited these diversions, and even had his
name printed on the ice, with those of several other
personages of the Royal Family. The author of
some curious verses, entitled, ‘<cite>Thamasis’s Advice to
the Painter, from her Frigid Zone: or Wonders upon

touch of the King’s humour, signifies ‘Jack in the

<p>“I am very much bounden to you, honest Mr.
Geoffrey,” recommenced the Antiquary, as I concluded,
“for these most appropriate and interesting
illustrations: for although the sports of this frost
can hardly be said to form an immediate portion of
the history of London Bridge, yet so memorable an
event on the Thames well deserves some pains to be
bestowed in recording it.</p>

<p>“The principal scene of this Blanket-Fair, indeed,&mdash;for
so the tents and sports on the Thames were denominated,&mdash;was
opposite to the Temple stairs, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
few, or none, of the festivities approached very near
to London Bridge; as we are informed by the many
rude, but curious memorials of it, which are yet in
existence. One of the most interesting of these is an
original and spirited, though unfinished, sketch in
pencil, slightly shaded with Indian ink; supposed
to have been the production of Thomas Wyck, an
artist particularly eminent for his views at this period.
In the right hand corner, at the top, the drawing is
dated in an ancient hand, ‘<em>Munday, February the 4</em>:
1683-4;’ and it consists of a view down the River
from the Temple-stairs to London Bridge, the buildings
of which are faintly seen in the back ground.
In front appear various groups of figures, and a side
prospect of that line of tents which stretched all
across the Thames, known during the frost by the
name of Temple-street. You will find this drawing
in volume viii. of Mr. Crowle’s Illustrated Pennant,
in the British Museum, after page 262; and it
measures 28 inches by 9<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>. Gough, in his ‘<cite>British
Topography</cite>,’ volume i., pages 731, 784,* mentions
several other publications ‘illustrative of this frost,
some of which are also in the same volume of Mr.
Crowle’s Pennant, and the principal particulars of
them I shall give you briefly in the following list.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the admiration with which London
Bridge had long been regarded, on account of its
appearance as an actual street over the Thames; in
1685 its very confined limits seem to have attracted
attention, and to have produced at least somewhat of
reformation. There is a tradition extant, though I have
not as yet been able to trace it to any printed authority,
that the cross over the dome of St. Paul’s
having been cast in Southwark, the street of London
Bridge was too narrow, and its numerous arches too
low, to allow of it being that way brought into the
City: and Hatton, in his ‘<cite>New View of London</cite>,’ volume
ii., page 791, shews us that in his time the enlarging
of the Bridge was recorded upon the North side of
the Nonesuch House, in the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">“‘<span class="smcap">Anno MDCLXXXV., et primo Jacobi II. Regis</span>,</p>

<p class="center">This Street was opened and enlarged from 12, to the
width of 20 foot:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir James Smith, Knight, Lord Mayor.</span>’
</p>

<p>“Even until the time, however, when London
Bridge was entirely cleared of its houses, the street
over it has always been described as dark, narrow,
and dangerous. ‘The houses on each side,’&mdash;says
Pennant, page 320,&mdash;‘overhung, and leaned in a most
terrific manner. In most places they hid the arches,
and nothing appeared but the rude piers.&mdash;I well
remember the street on London Bridge, narrow,
darksome, and dangerous to passengers, from the
multitude of carriages: frequent arches of strong
timber crossing the street, from the tops of the houses
to keep them together, and from falling into the river.
Nothing but use could preserve the repose of the inmates,
who soon grew deaf to the noise of falling
waters, the clamors of watermen, or the frequent
shrieks of drowning wretches. Most of the houses
were tenanted by pin or needle-makers, and economical
ladies were wont to drive from the St. James’s
end of the town, to make cheap purchases.’</p>

<p>“The ‘<cite>New and Universal History, Description,
and Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster,
the Borough of Southwark, and their adjacent parts</cite>,’
by Walter Harrison, London, 1776, folio, furnishes some
few additional features to this scene: although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
work itself is, perhaps, anything but reputable; being
chiefly a compilation from Stow and Strype, without
much acknowledgment of the originals. Some particulars
of London Bridge, however, the compiler himself
actually knew, and on page 24, he says,&mdash;‘Across the
middle of the street there were several lofty arches,
extending from one side to the other, the bottom part
of each arch terminating at the first story, and the
upper part reaching near the top of the buildings.
These arches were designed to support the houses on
each side the street, and were therefore formed of
strong timbers bolted into the houses, which, being
covered with lath and plaister, appeared as if built
with stone.’ The Rev. J. Motley, in his ‘<cite>Seymour’s
Survey of London</cite>,’ volume i., page 48, also says,&mdash;‘On
each side, between the houses, are left three vacancies,
opposite to each other, two with stone walls,
upon which are iron rails, that people passing along
may take a view of the river East and West, and may
also step out of the way of carts and coaches, the
passage being formerly very narrow, and the floors of
the houses that lay cross the streets being low, they
not only rendered those places dark, but likewise obstructed
the free passage of carts, if they were loaded
any way high, and coaches, so that they could not
pass by one another, which oftentimes occasioned
great stops upon the Bridge, and was a great hindrance
to passengers.’ As there was no regular foot-way
over the Bridge, it was therefore the most usual
and safest custom to follow a carriage which might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
passing across it. The brief notice of London Bridge
in Hoffmann’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lexicon Universale</cite>’ is not worth repeating,
but you will find it in volume iii., page 833,
column i., character <span lang="el" title="x">ξ</span>: and though a much better
account of it in 1697 appears in Motraye’s ‘<cite>Voyages</cite>,’
volume i., page 150, it contains nothing new. He
calls it ‘one of the strongest buildings which he had
seen in this nation.’</p>

<p>“A very melancholy instance of suicide which took
place in April, 1689, bears testimony to the power of
the torrent at London Bridge at that period; and you
will find it recorded in that very interesting work,
entitled ‘<cite>The Travels and Memoirs of Sir John
Reresby, Baronet</cite>,’ best edition, with a Preface by
Edmund Lodge, Esq., London, 1813, 8vo. page 406.&mdash;‘About
this time,’&mdash;says the Author of this volume,&mdash;‘a
very sad accident happened, which, for a
while, was the discourse of the whole town: Mr.
Temple, son to Sir William Temple, who had married
a French lady with 20,000 pistoles; a sedate and
accomplished young gentleman, who had lately by
King William been made Secretary of War; took a
pair of oars, and drawing near the Bridge, leapt into
the Thames and drowned himself, leaving a note
behind him in the boat, to this effect: ‘My folly
in undertaking what I could not perform, whereby
some misfortunes have befallen the King’s service, is
the cause of my putting myself to this sudden end;
I wish him success in all his undertakings, and a
better servant.’ Pennant, in repeating this anecdote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
in his ‘<cite>Account of London</cite>,’ page 323, adds that it took
place on the 14th of April; that the unhappy suicide
loaded his pockets with stones to destroy all chance
of safety; and that his father’s false and profane reflection
on the occasion was, ‘that a wise man might
dispose of himself, and make his life as short as he
pleased!’</p>

<p>“From a very remote period, the City of London
has protected the persons and property of its Orphans;
and so early as the year 1391 the Orphans’ Fund was
possessed of very considerable wealth, since the
sum of 2000 marks, or &pound;1333. 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>, was then borrowed
from it to procure corn during a dearth. In
the year 1693, the City stood indebted to the same
source, as well as to other creditors, in the amount of
&pound;747,500, and an Act of Parliament was at length
procured, establishing a fund for their re-payment; by
which all the City estates, excepting those belonging
to the Hospitals, London Bridge, and such places as
were liable to its repairs, were charged with raising
the annual sum of &pound;8000, clear of all deductions, as
a perpetual deposit for paying an interest of 4 per
cent. to the said creditors. The act itself is in volume
iii. of Owen Ruffhead’s ‘<cite>Statutes at Large</cite>,’
London, 1770, 4to., the 5th of William and Mary,
1694, chapter x., section 2. In which year also,
during the Mayoralty of Sir William Ashurst, the
Common Council passed an Act, on Wednesday the
15th of June, that as the ensuing Midsummer day,
the time for delivering the Bridge-House accounts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
would fall on a Sunday, for ever after, in such a case,
they were to be delivered the next day following. An
original copy of which Act is in the xxv.th volume of
London Tracts in the British Museum, folio.</p>

<p>“I have already mentioned several particulars of
the Bridge-House revenues, and the salaries of the
Wardens at various periods; and I shall now shew you
the ancient estimation of several other offices of the
same establishment. In the xxviii.th volume of London
Tracts last cited, is a folio sheet, entitled ‘<cite>A List of
the Rooms and Offices bought and sold in the City of
London</cite>;’ the total amount of which is &pound;145,586;
and there occur in it the following valuations of
places belonging to the Bridge. ‘1 Clerk of the
Bridge House, &pound;1250.&mdash;2 Carpenters of the Bridge-House,
&pound;200 each.&mdash;1 Mason of the Bridge-House,
&pound;200.&mdash;1 Plasterer to the Bridge-House, &pound;200.&mdash;1
Pavier to the Bridge House, &pound;250.&mdash;1 Plummer to
the Bridge-House, &pound;250.&mdash;2 Porters of the Bridge-House,
&pound;100 each.&mdash;1 Purveyor of the Bridge House,
&pound;200.&mdash;1 Shotsman of the Bridge-House, &pound;200.’
The whole of this list is also printed in Motley’s
‘<cite>Seymour’s Survey of London</cite>,’ volume i., page 261:
and at the end of the original is the following note,
more particularly fixing the time when these offices
were held in such estimation. ‘Whereas, James
Whiston, in a late book, intituled ‘<cite>England’s Calamities
Discovered</cite>,’ &amp;c.&mdash;London, 1696, quarto,&mdash;‘set
forth the mischievous consequences of buying and
selling places in Cities, States, and Kingdoms: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
the discovery of the disease being the first step towards
the cure; for that end some persons, well-affected
to the government of this City and Kingdom,
have taken great pains to find out the number and
value of y<sup>e</sup> places bought and sold within this City;
which are to y<sup>e</sup> best information that can at present
be got, as followeth.’&mdash;And now, pledge me once
more, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, in a farewell libation to
the seventeenth century, for this notice brings us
down to the year 1701.”</p>

<p>“Marry, Sir, and I’m heartily glad on’t,” said I,
“for I began to be like honest Bunyan’s Pilgrims on
‘the Enchanted Ground,’ and to have much ado to
keep my eyes open: but as I now really think
there is some <em>little</em> prospect that your tale will have
an end, I shall do mine endeavour to be wakeful
during the next century and a quarter, which you
have yet to lecture upon. And, in the meanwhile, like
Peter the Ziegenhirt, in Otmar’s German story, which
gave Geoffrey Crayon the idea of Rip Van Winkle,
I shall take another draught of the wine-pitcher; and
so once again, Mr. Barnaby, here’s to you.”</p>

<p>“My most hearty thanks are your’s,” replied he,
“and let me add, for your consolation, that I really
have comparatively but little to say in the next century;
for a great portion of it was occupied in
doubting whether the Bridge would stand, in surveying
its buildings, in repairing it, in disputing concerning
the erection of a new one, in receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
reports of architects, and in adopting schemes for its
alteration.</p>

<p>“The year 1701 may be considered as the important
period, when the Water-works at London
Bridge began to advance towards that extent and
power at which they afterwards arrived. Peter Moris,
the original inventor, had a lease from the City for
500 years, paying 10<em>s.</em> of yearly rent for the use of
the Thames water, one arch of the Bridge, and a
place on which he might erect his mill. The Citizens
soon experiencing the benefit of his invention, granted
him, two years after, a similar lease for a second arch,
by which his wealth considerably increased; and,
with various improvements, the property continued in
his family until this time, when the proprietor finding
his profits lessened by the works at the New River,
it was sold to one Richard Soams, Citizen and Goldsmith,
for &pound;36,000. That it might be the more
secure, Soams procured from the City, in confirmation
of his bargain, another grant for the fourth arch,&mdash;the
third belonging to a wharfinger,&mdash;and a new lease
of the unexpired term, at the yearly rent of 20<em>s.</em>, and
a fine of &pound;300. He then divided the whole property
into 300 shares of &pound;500 each, and formed it into a
company; all which information you will find in
Strype’s ‘Stow’s <cite>Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 29; and in
Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., pages 51, 52. Subsequently,
however, a fifth arch was granted by the
Court of Common Council, after a long debate, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
June the 23rd, 1767; under an express condition that
if, at any time, it should be found injurious to the
navigation of the river, the City might revoke their
grant, upon re-payment of the expenses. A particular
description of these works, which I shall speak of
hereafter, will be found in the ‘<cite>Philosophical
Transactions, volume xxxvii. for the years 1731, 1732</cite>,’
London, 1733, 4to. No. 417, pages 5-12, written by
Henry Beighton, with a plate, of which I possess the
original drawing, executed very carefully in pen-and-ink.</p>

<p>“The earliest view of London Bridge in this century,
I take to be that very barbarous print by Sutton
Nicholls, an Engraver who resided in London, about
the year 1710, was much employed by the booksellers,
and who executed several of the plates in Strype’s edition
of ‘Stow’s <cite>Survey</cite>.’ His prospect of the Bridge is
a large and coarse engraving in two sheets, measuring
35 inches, by 22&frac12;, and is divided lengthways into two
parts; the upper one entitled ‘<cite>The West side of London
Bridge</cite>,’ on a ribbon, and the lower one the Eastern
side, in the same manner. Both of these views are
horizontal, and of most execrable drawing, especially
with respect to the water and vessels; and the Print
seldom produces more than a few shillings, though
I should observe that there are two editions of it.
One bearing the imprint of ‘<cite>Printed for and Sold by
I. Smith, in Exeter Exchange in the Strand</cite>,’ which
is the earliest and best; and another marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span> ‘<em>Printed
for, and Sold by, Tho. Millward and Bis. Dickinson, at
Inigo Jones Head, next the Globe Tavern, in Fleet
Street</em>;’ which latter is probably still in existence,
as impressions of it are by no means rare. Below
the views are engraven ‘<cite>An Historical Description of
the great and admirable Bridge in the City of London
over the River of Thames</cite>,’ and Howell’s verses, which
I have already cited to you. But although its present
value is so trifling, it is yet far beyond the original
price of it, for in the Harleian MSS., No. 5956, is an
impression of the following curious original copper-plate
Prospectus for its publication:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Proposals for Printing a Prospect of London
Bridge, Thirty-five Inches Long, and Twenty-three
Inches Broad.</p>

<p>‘1st. Every Subscriber paying half a Crown at the
time of subscription, shall have a Prospect pasted on
Cloath in a Black Frame, paying half a Crown more
at the receipt thereof.</p>

<p>‘2dly. Every Subscriber paying one shilling at the
time of subscription, shall have one of the Prospects
on Paper only, paying one shilling more at the receipt
thereof.</p>

<p>‘3dly. He that subscribes, or procures subscriptions,
for six framed ones, shall have a seventh in a Frame,
Gratis; and he that subscribes, or procures subscriptions,
for six in sheets, shall have a seventh in sheets,
Gratis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>
<p>‘4thly. Any person that desires it, may see a Drawing
of the same in the hands of Sutton Nicholls, Ingraver,
against the George Inn, in Aldersgate Street, London,
where subscriptions are taken in. At the same place
is taught the Art of Drawing, by Sight, Measure, or
Instrument; also the Art of Writing: Prints and
Mapps, Surveys, Ground Plotts, Uprights, and Perspectives,
are there Drawn and Coloured at reasonable
rates.’ This view of London Bridge is mentioned by
Gough, in his ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ volume i., page
734.</p>

<p>“Although the Thames was again frozen over at intervals
in the year 1709, and some persons crossed it on
the ice, yet the frost was neither so intense nor so permanent
as to cause another fair; though, in the illustrated
Pennant in the British Museum, there is an
impression of a coarse bill, within a wood-cut border
of rural subjects, containing the words ‘<em>Mr. John
Heaton, Printed on the Thames at Westminster, Jan. the
7th, 1709. The Art and Mystery of Printing first invented

<p>“About the end of November 1715, however, a very
severe frost commenced, which continued until the
9th of the following February, when the sports of
1683 were all renewed; but of this I shall mention
only the few curious memorials of it to be found
in Mr. Crowle’s London collections in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>“In the year 1716, a very remarkable phenomenon
occurred at London Bridge, when, in consequence of
the long drought, the stream of the River Thames
was reduced so low, and from the effects of a violent
gale of wind, at West-South-West, was blown so dry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
that many thousands of people passed it on foot, both
above and below the Bridge, and through most of the
arches. Strype, in his edition of Stow’s ‘<cite>Survey</cite>,’
volume i., page 58, states, that he was an eye-witness
to this event; and observes that, on September 14th,
the channel in the middle of the River was scarcely
ten yards wide, and very shallow; the violence of the
wind having prevented the tide from coming up for
the space of four and twenty hours. Whilst the
Thames remained in this state, many interesting observations
were made on the construction and foundation
of London Bridge; and the ‘<cite>Weekly Packet</cite>,’
from September the 15th to September the 22d, states,
that a silver tankard, a gold ring, a guinea, and several
other things which had been lost there, were then
taken up.</p>

<p>“The author of ‘<cite>Wine and Walnuts</cite>,’ in one of his
chapters, which relate to this edifice, volume ii., page
112, gives a few notices of a feast held upon it in
April, 1722, whilst some repairs were carrying on
about the Draw-Bridge: and states, that it being settled
that the Bridge should be shut on the Saturday
and Sunday, the old street was empty and silent;
tables were set out in the highway, where, besides the
residents, several of the wealthy tradesmen in the vicinity
sat drinking through the afternoon; that they
might be enabled to say&mdash;adds Malcolm,&mdash;who notices
the circumstance in his ‘<cite>Anecdotes of the Manners
and Customs of London during the Eighteenth Century</cite>,’
London, 1808, quarto, volume ii., page 233,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>‘however
crowded the Bridge is, I have drank punch upon
it for great part of a day.’ Though I do not find this
festivity recorded in any of the public prints, yet in
the ‘<cite>Daily Courant</cite>’ for Friday, April the 13th, 1722,
is a notice from the Wardens of London Bridge, that
the Draw-Bridge Lock, through which hoys, lighters,
and other vessels usually passed, would be boomed up
on the following Wednesday, the 18th, for repairing;
whilst in the same paper for Friday, April the 20th,
a second notice appeared, that on Saturday, the 12th
of May, between the hours of 9 and 10 in the evening,
the Draw-Bridge itself would be taken up in order to
lay down a new one, which was completed by the
Thursday following. At the same time, the Rulers of
the Company of Watermen issued a notice, that the
Stairs at Pepper Alley would be dangerous during
the repairs; and that persons were requested to take
water higher up the River. It is also stated in the
‘<cite>Daily Post</cite>’ of Tuesday, May the 15th, that the new
Draw-Bridge was to be considerably stronger than
the old one, both in wood and iron; and that the
former had been laid down in the Whitsun holidays,
exactly fifty years previously, on May the 12th, 1672,
the work being completed in five days.</p>

<div>
<p>“About the end of the seventeenth century, the improvement
of the passage over London Bridge seems
to have been actively considered, if not executed: for
in 1697, the 8th and 9th year of William III., (chapter
xxxvii.,) an Act was passed concerning the Streets in
London, Westminster, Southwark, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span> ‘<em>and for widening
the Street at the South end of London Bridge</em>.’
In section 8 of which, it is stated that ‘the Corporation
of London have of late years, with great charge
and difficulty, pulled down and new built all the
houses upon London Bridge, and caused the street or
common passage over the same to be opened and enlarged;
which good and public intention is not yet
perfected, by reason of certain tenements on or near
the South end of the Bridge, which yet continue a
great hindrance to commerce by occasioning frequent
stops, and endangering the lives of many passengers.’
Commissioners are then appointed to treat with the
owners of such houses, as they shall think fit to
be pulled down. See the Act itself in Ruffhead’s
‘<cite>Statutes at Large</cite>,’ volume iii., page 687. Again, in
the year 1722, during the Mayoralty of Sir Gerard
Conyers, an Act was issued by the Corporation of
the City, for preserving the passage of the Bridge
free, which you may read at length in Motley’s
‘<cite>Seymour’s Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 49: it ordains
that there shall be three persons, appointed by the
Governors of Christ’s Hospital, the inhabitants of
Bridge Ward Within, and the Bridge-Masters, to give
daily attendance at each end of the Bridge. Their
duty being, to oblige all carriages coming from Southwark,
to keep the West side, and others the contrary;
and to prevent any cart from standing across the
Bridge to load or unload. It was also ordered, that
the Toll Collector&mdash;whose station was in the present
Watch House, at the North-west corner of the Bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>&mdash;should
collect the duties without delay; and, in
1723, they were ‘For every cart or waggon with shod
wheels, 4<em>d.</em>; For a dray with five barrels, 1<em>d.</em>; For
every pipe or butt, 1<em>d.</em>; For a ton of any goods, 2<em>d.</em>;
for any thing less than a ton, 1<em>d.</em>;’ which order was
directed to be printed and published in the most public
places within the City, and upon London Bridge
itself. I may merely add, that Maitland tells us in
his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., page 48, that in 1725, when
it was proposed to erect a Bridge at Westminster, Mr.
Henry Garbrand, the Deputy Comptroller of London
Bridge, and Mr. Bartholomew Sparruck, the Water
Carpenter, measured the River at this building, and
found it to be 915 feet 1 inch in breadth; the height of
the Bridge, 43 feet, 7 inches; the width of the street,
20 feet; and the depth of the houses on each side, 53
feet, or 73 feet in the whole. One of the last fires
which happened on London Bridge, took place on the
8th of September in this year, during the Mayoralty
of Sir George Mertins, Knight; and, as Motley tells
us in his ‘<cite>Seymour’s Survey</cite>,’ volume i., page 49,
commenced at the house of a brush-maker, near St.
Olave’s, Tooley Street, through the carelessness of a
servant. It burned down all the houses on that side
of the way as far as the Bridge-Gate, with several
of the buildings on the other; and ‘<cite>Mist’s Weekly
Journal</cite>,’ of Saturday, September the 11th, describes
it in the following words:&mdash;‘On Wednesday night,
between eleven and twelve o’clock, a fire broke out at
a Haberdasher’s of Hats, on the Bridge foot in Southwark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
which burnt on both sides of the way with great
violence for four or five hours. We hear that about
sixty houses are consumed, some upon the first and
second arch of the Bridge; and had it not been for
the stone gate which stopp’d the fire very much, the
rest of the houses on the Bridge had in all likelyhood
been down: the Bridge for some time was, by the
fall of the timber and rubbish, render’d impassable
for coaches, waggons, and carts, which were oblig’d
to cross over at Lambeth Ferry. The damage done
amounts to many thousands of pounds, but no just
computation can yet be made.’ The old Bridge-Gate
was so much damaged by this conflagration, that in
1726 it was taken down and re-built, being finished in
the year 1728. <span class="smcap">The New South Gate on London
Bridge</span>,</p>

<p class="pc"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>was furnished with two posterns for foot-passengers,
and was decorated with the Royal Arms, under which
was inscribed, ‘This Gate was widened from eleven
to eighteen feet, in the Mayoralty of Sir Edward
Becher, Knight, S. P. Q. L.’ The medalet, with a representation
of this edifice, I have already mentioned
to you, and it may now be stated that it was taken
down in the year 1760, with all the other buildings on
the Bridge, and the materials sold by auction. At which
sale, the fine old sculpture of the Royal Arms was
bought, with some other articles, by a Mr. Williams, a
stone-mason of Tooley Street; who, being soon after
employed to take down the gateway at Axe and Bottle
Yard, and to form the present King Street, in the
Borough, introduced several of the old Bridge materials
in erecting it. The ancient Royal Arms, too,
are yet to be seen on the front of a small public house,
on the right-hand side of the Western end of the same
street, between the numbers 4 and 67; with the inscription
‘G. III. R. 1760., King Street,’ carved around
them. Mr. Williams also bought several of the facing
stones of the old London Bridge, of which he built a
very curious house, the roof being of the same stone,
and which, about three years since, was standing
in Lock’s Fields, near Prospect Row, Newington,
usually known by the name of ‘<cite>Williams’s Folly</cite>.’
The new Bridge-Gate stood near the corner of Pepper
Alley Stairs, and you will find a representation of it
in the Frontispiece to the first volume of Maitland’s
‘<cite>History</cite>.’ I imagine, that upon the removal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
old gate, the custom of erecting the heads of traitors
there was discontinued, as I find no subsequent
notice of it; and the last heads which, probably, were
placed upon its towers, are said to have been those of
the Regicides in 1661, as I have shewn from Monconys,
though, in the numerous pamphlets of their
Trials, &amp;c., I find no account of their being thus
disposed. From ‘<cite>The Traytors’ Perspective Glass</cite>,’
London, 1662, 4to., we learn, however, that the heads
of Cromwell and Ireton were set over Westminster
Hall; and of the others, it is said, ‘their heads, <em>in several
places</em>, are become a spectacle both to angels and
men, and a prey to birds of the air.’</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 26th of December, 1739-40,
commenced another Frost, the most severe which had
occurred since 1716. The Thames, as we are told
by the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,’ of 1740, volume x.,
page 35, January 31, floated with rocks and shoals of
ice; and when they fixed, represented a snowy field,
every where rising in masses and hills of ice and snow.
Of this scene, several artists made sketches; whilst
tents and printing-presses were erected, and a complete
Frost-fair was again held upon the River, over
which multitudes walked, though some lost their
lives by their rashness. It was in this fair that Doll,
the Pippin-woman, whom I before mentioned, lost
her life, as Gay relates it in the Second Book of his
‘<cite>Trivia</cite>,’ verses 375-392; the last line of which seems
to be an imitation of that song which we formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
considered, and which was extremely popular even in
the time of Gay himself. The passage I particularly
allude to is this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Doll every day had walk’d these treacherous roads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her neck grew warp’d beneath Autumnal loads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of various fruit: she now a basket bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That head, alas! shall basket bear no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each booth she frequent past, in quest of gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boys with pleasure heard her thrilling strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Doll! all mortals must resign their breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And industry itself submit to death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crackling crystal yields; she sinks, she dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head, chopt off, from her lost shoulders flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pippins she cried, but death her voice confounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pip&mdash;pip&mdash;pip, along the ice resounds.’</span>
</div></div>

<p>“Mr. J. T. Smith, in his ‘<cite>Ancient Topography of
London</cite>,’ page 24, states that another remarkable
character, called ‘<em>Tiddy Doll</em>,’ died in the same place
and manner.</p>

<p>“In the treasures of Mr. Crowle’s Illustrated Pennant,
are several contemporary memorials of this Fair;
which I shall very briefly mention, and give some
specimens of the poetry attached to them.</p>

<p>“A coarse copper-plate, entitled ‘<cite>The View of
Frost Fair</cite>,’ 10&frac14; inches by 12, scene taken from York-buildings
Water-Works; twelve verses beneath.</p>

<p>“A copper-plate, 7&frac12; inches by 5, representing an
altar-piece with the ten commandments, engraven

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>of Thames, Jan<sup>ry.</sup> 15, 1739</em>.’</p>

<p>“A coarse copper-plate engraving, looking down
the River, entitled ‘<cite>Frost Fair</cite>,’ with eight lines of
verse beneath; and above ‘<em>Printed upon the River
Thames when Frozen, Janu. the 28,
17<sup>39</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub></em>.’ 9&frac12; inches
by 12&frac14;.</p>

<p>“A copper-plate 5 inches by 8&frac14;, representing an
ornamental border with a female head, crowned at the
top; and below, two designs of the letter-press and
rolling press. In the centre in type, ‘<em>Upon the Frost
in the year 1739-40</em>;’ six verses, and then ‘<em>Mr. John
Cross, aged 6. Printed on the Ice upon the Thames,
at Queen-Hithe, January the 29th, 1739-40</em>.’</p>

<p>“A copper-plate, representing a view of the
Thames at Westminster, with the tents, sports, &amp;c.,
and alphabetical references, entitled ‘<cite>Ice Fair</cite>.’

</div></div>

<p>“An altered copy of these verses was printed upon
the Thames in the great Frost of 1814; and from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
advertisement in the ‘<cite>London Daily Post</cite>’ of Thursday,
January the 31st, 1739-40, we learn that this and
the following print were originally sold for 6<em>d.</em> each.</p>

<p>“A Copper-plate printed in red, 9&frac12; inches by 13&frac14;,
the view taken opposite St. Paul’s, with tents, sports,
&amp;c. in front, sixteen lines of verse beneath, with
‘<em>Frost and Ice Fair, shewing the diversions upon the
River Thames, began the 26th of Decem<sup>r</sup> 1739-40,
ended Febru<sup>ry</sup> the 17th</em>.’”</p>

<p>“In the beginning of this Frost, the houses on
London Bridge appear to have received considerable
damage, from the many vessels which broke from
their moorings, and lay beating against them; the
notice of which, we derive from the two most celebrated
newspapers of the time,&mdash;the ‘<cite>Daily Post</cite>,’
and Woodfall’s ‘<cite>General Advertiser</cite>.’ The latter of
these, for Monday, December the 31st, 1739, states
that ‘all the watermen above the Bridge have hauled
their boats on shore, the Thames being very nigh
frozen over:’ and in the same paper, for Wednesday,
January 2nd, 1739-40, it is observed, that ‘several
vintners in the Strand bought a large Ox in Smithfield
on Monday last, which is to be roasted whole on the ice
on the River of Thames, if the Frost continues. Mr.
Hodgeson, a Butcher in St. James’s Market, claims
the privilege of selling, or knocking down, the
Beast, as a right inherent in his family, his Father
having knocked down the Ox roasted on the River
in the great Frost, 1684; as himself did that roasted
in 1715, near Hungerford Stairs. The Beast is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
be fixt to a stake in the open market, and Mr.
Hodgeson comes dress’d in a rich lac’d cambric
apron, a silver steel, and a Hat and Feathers, to
perform the office.’ After the mention of numerous
accidents near London Bridge, the repetition of
which would occupy considerable time with but little
gratification, the ‘<cite>Daily Post</cite>,’ of Tuesday, January
the 22nd, 1740, thus notices the first breaking-up of
this famous frost. ‘Yesterday morning, the inhabitants
of the West prospect of the Bridge were
presented with a very odd scene, for, on the opening
of their windows, there appear’d underneath, on the
River, a parcel of booths, shops, and huts, of different
forms, and without any inhabitants, which, it seems,
by the swell of the waters and the ice separating,
had been brought down from above. As no lives
were lost, it might be view’d without horror. Here
stood a booth with trinkets, there a hut with a dram
of old gold; in another place a skittle-frame and
pins, and in a fourth ‘the Noble Art and Mystery of
Printing, by a servant to one of the greatest trading
companies in Europe.’ With much difficulty, last
night, they had removed the most valuable effects.’
To conclude my information upon this subject, I
have to observe only that the ‘<cite>Daily Post</cite>’ of Thursday,
February the 14th, states that the Sterlings of
London Bridge had received so much damage during
the frost from the great weight of ice, that their repairs
would amount to several thousand pounds.</p>

<p>“There appears to be some little inaccuracy in
this statement by Maitland, since the amounts which
he sets down are not the products of the sums when
added together; but these I have rectified, though
the balance of the whole account does not quite
accord with the sums remaining in hand.</p>

<p>“We have at length reached that period, when the
extensive alteration, or even re-building, of London
Bridge, began to form a matter of grave and active
consideration; and in relating the proceedings of these
times, there will be no little difficulty in condensing
into one consecutive account, all the numerous surveys,
reports, plans, proposals, and objections, which
were then published. In treating of this part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
subject, however, as it will be best and briefest to do
it in order, we will first consider the state of old
London Bridge, as it was represented by the various
Architects employed to survey it; then give some
account of the schemes proposed for its alteration;
and lastly, describe that which was adopted, and the
means used for carrying it into effect.</p>

<p>“It appears extremely probable, that the contrast
presented by the broad and clear road of the new
Bridge at Westminster,&mdash;which was commenced in
September, 1738, and completed in November, 1749,&mdash;chiefly
contributed to turn the attention of the Corporation
of London to the exceeding inconvenience of
their own. Though to the building of Westminster
Bridge, Maitland, who knew the circumstances, tells
us in his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume ii., page 1349, that there
was very considerable opposition; and that the City
of London, the Borough of Southwark, the Company
of Watermen, and the West-Country Bargemen, all
petitioned the Parliament against it. On Friday,
February the 22d, 1754, as we learn from the ‘<cite>Public
Advertiser</cite>’ of the day following, the Court of Common
Council took into consideration a motion for the
construction of a new Bridge between London and
Southwark: when, after a debate of nearly four hours,
it was withdrawn, and a Committee appointed, consisting,
as usual, of the Aldermen, Deputies, and one
Common-Councilman from each Ward, to consider of
the best means of rendering the old Bridge safe and
convenient; who were empowered to draw upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Chamberlain to the amount of &pound;100, for plans, surveys,
&amp;c. The Report of this Committee stated, that the
Bridge foundation was still good, and that, by pulling
down the houses, and making such repairs as should
then be required, the edifice might be rendered equally
serviceable with Westminster Bridge; being capable
of receiving four carriages abreast, with a good foot way
on each side. By pulling down the houses at the corners
of the narrow streets leading to the old Bridge, it
was also represented that it would be rendered so convenient
as to supersede the erection of any new one.
To this it was objected, that most of the houses declined
considerably out of the perpendicular; and that
those on the Eastern side of the Bridge decayed much
faster than the opposite ones. In Harrison’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’
page 24, this account is partly confirmed; since we
are there told that ‘on the outer part of the Bridge,
on the East side, the view from the wharfs and quays
was exceedingly disagreeable. Nineteen disproportioned
arches, with sterlings increased to an amazing
size by frequent repairs, supported the street above.
These arches were of very different sizes, and several
that were low and narrow were placed between others
that were broad and lofty. The back part of the
houses next the Thames had neither uniformity nor
beauty; the line being broken by a great number of
closets that projected from the buildings, and hung
over the sterlings. This deformity was greatly increased
by the houses extending a considerable distance
over the sides of the Bridge, and some of them projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
farther over it than the others; by which
means, the tops of almost all the arches, except those
that were nearest, were concealed from the view of
the passengers on the quays, and made the Bridge
appear like a multitude of rude piers, with only an
arch or two at the end, and the rest, consisting of
beams, extending from the tops of flat piers, without
any other arches, quite across the river.’</p>

<div>
<p>“The best view of London Bridge in this state, is
represented in an engraving by Peter Charles Canot,
from a picture painted by Samuel Scott, of whom
Walpole says, ‘if he were but second to Vandevelde
in sea-pieces, he excelled him in variety, and often
introduced buildings in his pictures with consummate
skill. His views of London Bridge, of the Quay at
the Custom-House, &amp;c. were equal to his Marines.’
He died October the 12th, 1772; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> the ‘<cite>Anecdotes
of Painting</cite>,’ page 445. This view is also noticed by
Gough in his ‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ volume i., page
735: and Mr. J. T. Smith, in his ‘<cite>Ancient Topography</cite>,’
page 25, observes, that it was in the possession of
Edward Roberts, Esq., Clerk of the Pells, who probably
still retains it. It was exhibited, says the author
of ‘<cite>Wine and Walnuts</cite>,’ volume i., page 65, in 1817,
at the British Institution; and of the excellent engraving
from it there are two editions: the earliest and
best is marked, ‘<em>Published according to Act of Parliament,
Feb<sup>y</sup>. 25, 1761</em>:’ and the latter may be known
by the imprint of ‘<em>Printed for Bowles and Carver,
R. H. Laurie, and R. Wilkinson</em>.’ This plate has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
been more than once copied in a reduced form; but
the best, engraved by Warren, appeared in that work
by Dr. Pugh, known by the name of ‘<cite>Hughson’s
History of London</cite>,’ London, 1806-9, octavo, volume
ii., page 316. Another view of London Bridge with
the houses, of considerably less merit, but rather more
rarity, was ‘<em>Printed and sold for John Bowles, Print
and Map-seller, over against Stocks-Market, 1724</em>.’
It consists of a small square plate, and shews the
houses on the Western side of the edifice in bad perspective,
with a short historical account beneath it;
and it forms plate y of a folio volume, entitled, ‘<cite>Several
Prospects of the most noted Buildings in and about
the City of London</cite>.’ There are also some rather large
representations of this Bridge, in most of the old two
and three-sheet views of London; as in those published
by Bowles ‘<em>at the Black Horse in Cornhill</em>,’ about
1732, &amp;c.; and in the series of prints usually called
‘<cite>Boydell’s Perspectives</cite>,’ is a folio half-sheet plate very
much resembling Scott’s, entitled ‘<cite>A view of London
Bridge taken near St. Olave’s Stairs. Published
according to Act of Parliament by J. Boydell, Engraver,
at the Globe, near Durham Yard in the Strand.
1731. Price 1s. J. Boydell, delin. et sculp.</cite>’ I could
mention several others, as in the Title-page to the old
‘<cite>London Magazine</cite>;’ in Strype’s edition of Stow; in
Maitland; Motley’s ‘Seymour’s <cite>Survey</cite>;’ in Hughson,
Lambert, and numerous other works; but for fidelity
of feature, and excellence of effect, none of them are
in any respect equal to that of Scott, representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>

<p>“As at this period the public attention was generally
directed towards this edifice, the proprietors of
Maitland’s ‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ which was then appearing
in numbers, issued an Advertisement, in the
‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of Saturday, April the 6th, 1754,
stating that ‘Number xv. will be illustrated with two
fine Prospects of London Bridge as it may be altered
agreeable to drawings presented to Sir Richard Hoare,
by Charles Labelye, Esq.; and humbly inscribed to
the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council,
who <em>now</em> have the state of that Bridge under consideration.&mdash;Not
one of this Number will be delivered
to any but Subscribers, and such as have bought, or
shall buy, the former Numbers.’ Like Strype’s edition
of Stow, this work was published at 6<em>d.</em> each
Number.</p>

<p>“On Thursday, September the 26th, 1754, the
Bridge Committee presented their Report to the
Court of Common-Council, an original verbatim
copy of which is in the xxviiith. volume of ‘<cite>London
Tracts</cite>’ in the British Museum, small folio. This
Report stated, that the piles, &amp;c. of old London Bridge
having been surveyed by Mr. George Dance, then
Clerk of the Works to the City, the foundations were
declared good, and, with common repairs, likely to
last for ages. That the houses on the Bridge being a
public inconvenience, it was recommended that they
should be removed, from St. Magnus’ Church to the
City Gate, on the East; and from the corner of
Thames Street to the Bear Tavern in the Borough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
on the West. That Mr. Dance had produced a plan
for an alteration of the Bridge, with estimates amounting
to &pound;30,000, in which were a carriage-road of 33
feet, with two foot-paths of 6 feet each; but that
such expense might be reduced to &pound;27,000, by leaving
the houses standing on the South side of the Gate.
That the annual rents of the houses to be taken down
amounted to about &pound;828: 6<em>s.</em>, which would be lost to
the Bridge-House estates; whilst the Parishes of St.
Magnus and St. Olave would also lose in taxes, rents,
and tythes, about the yearly sum of &pound;484: 19<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em>;
and that the estimate of the houses then out upon
lease, with others which must be bought, came to
&pound;8940: 11<em>s.</em> 7<em>d.</em>; besides other satisfaction which might
be required by the under-tenants.</p>

<p>“The substance of Labelye’s plan for altering this
edifice, is given in Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume ii.,
pages 826-832, together with the result of several
other reports made in 1746. His chief objection to
old London Bridge was to the sterlings surrounding
the piers; which, occupying almost one fourth part in
five of the water-way, caused a fall of nearly five feet
perpendicular, during the greater part of every tide,
thus rendering the passage of vessels through the
locks equally difficult and dangerous. He, consequently,
proposed casing the piers with four feet of
Portland Stone, and to lessen the sterlings so as
always to have about 400 feet of water-way, which,
being twice as much as the Bridge originally possessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
would reduce the fall to about 15 inches. The
expense of this plan, he conceived, would be about
&pound;2000 for each pier; two or three of which could be
altered in a year, without stopping the passage either
over or under the Bridge. He also proposed to adopt
the idea of Sir Christopher Wren, in new-modelling
the appearance of the building itself, by taking away
eleven piers, and forming nine broad-pointed Gothic
arches, springing from the lowest low-water mark:
these were to be of different dimensions, and the fifth
from the South end was to be 90 feet in span. The
parapet was to be ornamented with Gothic crocketted
recesses surmounting the piers; by a cast-iron ballustrade;
or by a dwarf-wall, or even houses; and,
according to this plan, there would have been a water-way
of 540 feet, and a fall of not more than 9 inches;
whilst the amount of time and expense would not be
considerably greater than in the former.</p>

<p>“The Reports of Mr. George Dance, Clerk of the
City Works, and Bartholomew Sparruck, the Water-Carpenter
of London Bridge, in answer to the questions
of the Committee, in 1746, also furnish several
very curious and interesting particulars concerning the
building at that period, and the original is to be found
at length in Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ already cited; and
in Nos. II. and III. of Dr. Charles Hutton’s ‘<cite>Tracts
on Mathematical and Philosophical Subjects</cite>,’ London,
1812, volume i., pages 115-122. The Report commences
with a table of the depth of water, above,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
immediately under, and below every arch, beginning
at the South end of the Bridge, which is to the following

<p>“The Report then proceeds to state, that the height
of the under bed of the first course of stones is very
unequal; some being 2 feet 4 inches; and others varying
from 1 foot 3 inches, to 1 foot 11 inches above low-water
mark; and from 4 to 6 feet above the level of
the sterlings. The rough and unhewn piles were
found to be shod with iron, and but little decayed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
in some instances, they were separated from the stone-work
by planks of oak and elm, from 4 to 6 inches in
thickness, which were probably first inserted at some
of the numerous repairs; and each of the piers was
protected by a stone base, extending about 7 inches
beyond them. It was from these reports, that Mr.
Labelye drew up his plans, which, together with his
remarks on the old Bridge, were presented to the
Committee, on Wednesday, the 17th of September,
1746. As this Architect desired that his designs
might be examined by some eminent, scientific, and
disinterested individuals, several such persons were
called in to assist the deliberations of the Committee;
though, after many other inquiries and consultations,
the discussions terminated in a proposal for building
a new Bridge at Blackfriars.</p>

<p>“At a Court of Common Council holden on Thursday,
December 18th, 1755, after a very protracted
opposition, the Corporation consequently agreed to
petition Parliament for leave to bring in a Bill to erect
another Bridge over the Thames at Fleet-Ditch, and
on Tuesday, January 13th, 1756, the petition was
presented and referred to a Committee; another petition
being also presented at the same time, praying
leave to bring in a Bill for improving and widening
the passage over London Bridge, by removing the
houses and other obstructions thereon, and for raising
money to enable the Trustees to render the same safer
and more commodious. This also was referred to a
Committee; on Friday, March 12th, 1756, leave was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
granted to bring in the Bills; and on Thursday, the
27th of May, they both received the Royal assent,
when the King closed the Session of Parliament.
These Acts are printed in Maitland’s ‘<cite>History</cite>,’
volume ii., page 1387; though the best authority is
Ruffhead’s ‘<cite>Statutes at Large</cite>,’ volume vii., pages
728-738, 29th of George II., Chapter xl.; and I shall
first give a very few particulars of the Act relating to
London Bridge, and next shew how the alteration was
effected. By this Statute, then, the Corporation was
empowered to buy and remove all buildings on, and
contiguous to, the Bridge, for enlarging its avenues,
improving the passage over, and widening one or more
of its arches:&mdash;to devise how the same should be executed,
and kept in repair:&mdash;to erect an uniform ballustrade
on each side, with a passage of 31 feet for
carriages, &amp;c., and 7 feet for each of the footways:&mdash;to
have it lighted and watched at the expense of the
Bridge-House estates:&mdash;to preserve the arches and
pipes belonging to the Water-works:&mdash;to establish,
after the 24th of June, 1756, an additional toll for
the payment of the expenses incurred by the alterations:&mdash;to
keep the Bridge clear of buildings, and of
carriages standing upon it for hire, after the houses
should be removed; and to make all carriages keep on
the Eastern side in going towards Southwark, and on
the Western side in coming to London. The Act also
provided penalties for destroying the Bridge or any
of its works; extensive powers for the Corporation in
buying the various property; an equivalent for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
tythes, rates, &amp;c., payable to the Rectors of St. Magnus
and St. Margaret, and St. Olave; and particular
ordinances concerning the tolls.</p>

<p>“Gates and toll-houses were to be erected on, or
near, London Bridge; but to continue only until the
principal and interest of the borrowed monies should
be discharged. The additional tolls were, ‘for every
horse drawing any coach, chariot, hearse, berlin,
landau, calash, chaise, or chair, over the Bridge, 1<em>d.</em>;
for every such carriage itself, 1<em>d.</em>; and for every horse
not drawing, passing across the Bridge, &frac12;<em>d.</em>’ Loaded
vessels also, passing under the Bridge, were to pay
2<em>d.</em> for every 5 tons burthen; 3<em>d.</em> for ten tons; 6<em>d.</em>
for 25 tons, and 1<em>s.</em> for vessels of greater capacity.
In the Act for building a Bridge at Blackfriars, 29th
of George II.&mdash;1756,&mdash;Chapter lxxxvi., it is stated,
that the taking away of all tolls from that of London,
as soon as possible, would be of general advantage,
they being then leased out for 21 years at a fine of
&pound;2100, and a yearly rent of &pound;735; the redemption of
all which was estimated at &pound;36,000. In 1757, the
31st of George II., Chapter xx., an aid of &pound;15,000
was granted by Parliament towards the rebuilding
of London Bridge, because the tolls were not only
difficult to collect, but were also a considerable hindrance
to commerce and navigation: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> the ‘<cite>Continuation
of Maitland’s History</cite>,’ at the end of volume
ii., page 19. The powers of the new Act&mdash;which
also protected the Bridge and its works, by making
it felony to destroy them,&mdash;commenced from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
21st of April, and the additional tolls of the former
one ceased from the 24th of June, 1758. Whilst I
am upon the subject, it will probably be as well to
include all our notices of the tolls of London Bridge
under one head; and therefore I may remark, that in
1767, the 7th of George III., Chapter xxxvii., an
Act was passed for the completing of Blackfriars
Bridge, making several improvements in the City,
and for treating with Mr. Edward Neale, the Lessee
of the tolls of London Bridge, for their redemption;
to which latter purpose, the sum of &pound;30,000 was
appropriated. About the end of September, 1770,
the Corporation proceeded to act upon this power,
fifteen years and three quarters being then unexpired
of the lease; but the lessee having altered his
demand, on account of the tolls having increased
upwards of &pound;600 per annum since 1766, it was found,
that to reimburse the City, it was essential that they
should continue both upon London and Blackfriars
Bridges for some years longer. Upon petition of the
Corporation, therefore, in the 11th of George III.,
1771, Chapter xx., an Act was passed for further continuing
the tolls on London Bridge until March the
25th, 1782, when the remainder of the lease was to be
bought and the tolls finally to cease. All these particulars
will be found in the ‘<cite>Statutes at Large</cite>,’ volumes
vii., pages 728-738, 742; viii., page 210; x., pages
306, 307; and xi., pages 154, 155; there is also considerable
information upon this subject, to be found in
Malcolm’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Londinum Redivivum</cite>,’ volume ii., pages 392<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>-396,
derived from authentic documents. From
these authorities it appears that the amount of the
prescriptive tolls of London Bridge, at Midsummer,
1763, produced &pound;1785: 10<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em>; in 1764, &pound;1946:
4<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em>; in 1765, &pound;1846: 7<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>; in 1766, &pound;1878: 16<em>s.</em>
6<em>d.</em>; and in 1770, &pound;2465: 14<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em>; estimating, therefore,
the average to be about &pound;1864, and deducting
from that sum the Rent, &pound;735; Land Tax, &pound;180: 12<em>s.</em>
and the expenses of collecting, &pound;150, the lessee’s
clear annual income would be &pound;798: 15<em>s.</em></p>

<p>“It was upon this calculation that the value of the
remainder of his lease was ascertained, and the Act
for continuing the tolls first devised; though on
Wednesday, April, 24th, 1765, the Committee of City
Lands let to Mr. Neale a lease of 21 years of the toll
of carts and wheelage over London Bridge, for a
fine of 2000 guineas, and the old rent of &pound;735 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
annum</i>. See the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>’ for 1765,
volume xxxv., page 197.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding, however, these active proceedings
for the improvement of this edifice, the parties
in favour of, and against, a new building ran
extremely high, as you may see in the ‘<cite>Continuation
of Maitland’s History</cite>,’ page 4. That several interests
were to be consulted in the alteration of London
Bridge, is evident, and they are particularly shewn in
the counter-petitions presented to Parliament whilst
the Bridge Bills were pending; as, one drawn up
by the most ardent supporters of the new Bridge
at Blackfriars; and another by the Rev. Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
Gibson, Rector of St. Magnus and St. Margaret, for
recompense in loss of tythes, &amp;c. to the amount of
&pound;48: 6<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>, by taking down the houses. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> the
‘<cite>Journals of the House of Commons</cite>,’ volume xxvii.,
page 574; and the ‘<cite>Continuation of Maitland’s History</cite>,’
page 11; on page 7 of which authority it is also
stated, that on the 12th of June, 1755, ‘the Common-Council
allowed the Comptroller of the Bridge-House
&pound;410 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>, in lieu of his customary bills,
which were so much reduced by the loss that would
accrue to the Bridge-House estate, in the repairing
and improvement of London Bridge.’ But whilst
many persons were too much interested even in the
worst state of it, with all its inconvenient buildings,
not to oppose their alteration, they were found to be
almost equally dangerous both on the edifice and on
the water. In the proceedings in Parliament concerning
the alterations, Mr. Dance, the Architect, stated,
that the piers were solid for ten feet above the
sterlings, upon which were erected walls of three feet
in thickness, forming cellars to the houses; and they
having settled, the walls were much injured. In consequence,
also, of the contracted passage between the
houses upon the Bridge, the inhabitants experienced
many inconveniences peculiar to their situation. Mr.
Deputy James Hodges declared, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span> ‘had frequently
known it happen, that coals had been thrown
through the windows of the houses, out of the
barges going under the Bridge; and that, as he is
informed, the reason is, that the candle-lights in the
houses make it dangerous in the night-time to go
through the locks. That people on the river have
always a glimmering light by which they can distinguish
objects, unless a very thick fog. That light
leaves them just when they come to shoot the locks, as
far as the shadows of the houses extend; and thereby
they lose the possibility of discerning the passage
between the sterlings.’ See Malcolm’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Londinum
Redivivum</cite>,’ volume ii., page 388, and the ‘<cite>Journals of
the House of Commons</cite>.’ The improvement of the passage
over London Bridge was, however, much accelerated
by the passing of an Act in 1755, the 28th of
George II., Chapter ix., for taking away the ancient
Market then held in High Street, Southwark, after
Lady-day, 1756: and in Chapter xxii. of the former
year, it was removed to its recent place on the site of
Rochester Yard. See Bray’s ‘<cite>History of Surrey</cite>,’
volume iii., page 550; and the ‘<cite>Statutes at Large</cite>,’
volume vii., pages 579, 620. Having thus, then, given
some idea of the proceedings of the Corporation before
the improvement of the old London Bridge, let us now
go on to consider the nature and manner of that
alteration itself: and so, if you’re not asleep, Mr.
Barbican, here’s your health.”</p>

<p>“No, truly,” replied I, wakefully endeavouring
to appear as brisk as my drowsiness would
let me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span> “Time has a wonderful effect in reconciling
us to the most tiresome employments; and I doubt
not but to be able to hold out through the remainder
of your discourse, with the aid of this Sack-posset,
which seems to be little less interminable, and heated
beyond the power of cooling again. But go on,
Master Barnaby, go on, Sir.”</p>

<div>
<p>“You are next to be informed then,” recommenced
the Antiquary, “that we are told by the Rev. John
Entick, in his ‘<cite>Continuation of Maitland’s History</cite>,’
page 19, that the Committee appointed to repair
London Bridge resolved to take down all the buildings
and erections which stood upon it, of every kind
whatsoever: to remove the great middle pier, and to
lay the two adjoining locks into one, by turning an
entire new arch, occupying the whole space: to add
the depth of the removed houses to the width of the
Bridge: and to secure both sides by a stone wall
breast-high, surmounted by lofty ballustrades. To
effect all this, it was essential to stop up the Bridge,
and, at the same time, to provide a convenient passage
to Southwark; on which, it was determined to construct
a Temporary Bridge of Wood. This edifice consisted
of stout unplaned oak timbers, to the amount
of &pound;2000; and it was erected on the sterlings in a
curved form, on the Western side of the stone one, into
which it opened at each end, extending from the
water-works to about the fourth arch on the Surrey
side of the river. The timber being taken back by the
builder, his labour in erecting and removing it being
compensated, and one penny per cube foot allowed him
for the use of the materials. In Harrison’s ‘<cite>History
of London</cite>,’ page 409, it is stated, that this temporary
Bridge was opened in the month of October, 1757,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
when it was ‘found to be very convenient, not only
for foot-passengers, but also for horsemen and carriages;’
but there are few notices to be found of it in
the public prints of the period. By ‘<cite>Lloyd’s Evening
Post and British Chronicle</cite>,’ however, a quarto newspaper
of several leaves, then published every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, we are informed, in the paper
for Wednesday, September 21st, page 219, that, ‘to-morrow
they will begin to lay the first coat of gravel
on the Temporary Bridge, so that it will be passable
by the end of this month:’ and the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
of Saturday, October 22nd, thus fixes the time
when the Bridge was actually finished. ‘Yesterday,
the Committee appointed under the late Act of Parliament
for the improvement of London Bridge, met
and view’d the Temporary Bridge, and gave orders
to have it open’d to-morrow morning for foot-passengers.’
The houses on the stone edifice, indeed,
were already began to be removed; for, in the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite>,’ for 1757, volume xxvii., page 91,
it is stated, that on Tuesday, February 22nd, ‘three
pots of money, silver and gold, of the coin of Queen
Elizabeth, were found by the workmen in pulling
down the houses on London Bridge.’ The whole of
these buildings, however, were not entirely taken
away until some years after this time; for in the ‘<cite>London
Chronicle</cite>’ of Thursday, May 17th, 1759, the name
of ‘William Herbert on London Bridge,’ occurs as one
of the publishers of ‘<cite>The Lives of the Reformers</cite>.’ By
the same paper, too, for Thursday, August the 14th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
1760, page 161, we are informed, that ‘in pulling
down the house called the Chapel-House, on London
Bridge, there has been found this week a very antique
marble font, &amp;c. curiously engraved, and several ancient
coins, &amp;c. The stones used in the building of
this structure were so strongly cemented with different
kinds of mortar, and strong iron clamps, that the
workmen found a most difficult task in the demolition
of it, which is not yet completed.’ The Committee
for altering London Bridge had, however, previously
advertised for persons to carry their intentions into
effect, to meet at Guildhall on the 1st of February,
1757; as may be seen in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of
Monday, January 24th; and in the same authority for
Monday, May the 2nd following, it is further stated,
that Messrs. Blackden and Flight, the contractors for
taking down and clearing away the houses on London
Bridge, completed their engagement on the Saturday
evening previously: and that from the commencement
of their work, there had not occurred a single
accident. The view of old London Bridge and its
buildings by Scott, to which I have already referred,
furnishes us with large and interesting prospects of
several of the principal edifices which, after this period,
were removed; and I may add, that in the x.th
volume of Mr. Crowle’s Illustrated Pennant, there is
an enlarged drawing of this picture, executed by John
Varley, in colours, measuring 3 feet 9&frac12; inches, by 1
foot 5&frac34;; ruthlessly cut into three parts to fit the
size of the book. In these views, one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
curious objects is a prospect of the <span class="smcap">Eastern Exterior
of the Chapel of St. Thomas in 1757</span>;</p>

<p class="pc">a more particular engraving of which you will find in
the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,’ for 1753, volume xxiii.,
page 432. But few remains of the original structure
were then perceptible on the outside of this building;
though its form of a semi-hexagon might be
traced, whilst the old pier of the Bridge, the basement
standing on the sterling, and some of the pinnacles
and buttresses of the Chapel, were discernible
in the centre and at the sides. The greater part of
it, however, was scarcely to be distinguished from
the other houses, being covered with brickwork or
boarding; whilst the Upper Chapel was converted
into apartments, and the Lower one into the Paper
Warehouse of Messrs. Gill and Wright, having a
crane attached to it to take in goods from boats. In
front of the Bridge pier, a square fish-pond was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
formed in the sterling, into which the fish were carried
by the tide, and then detained there by a wire-grating
placed over it: and an ancient servant of
London Bridge, now verging upon his hundredth
summer, well remembers to have gone down through
the Chapel to fish in this pond.</p>

of several persons in trade, or perhaps was shut

whilst above is shewn the third of those open spaces
guarded with iron rails, which alone varied the street-like
character of old London Bridge, and indicated to
its passengers that they were actually crossing a river.
I know but of one engraving, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican,
which gives us any view directly up the Bridge-street;
and even that is so slight, that were it not that
I am unwilling to lose any fragment relating to old
London Bridge, I should omit mentioning it altogether.
You will find it, however, in that half-sheet
copper-plate, after Antonio Canaletti, published in
‘<cite>Bowles’s Perspectives</cite>,’ entitled ‘<cite>The Monument of
London in remembrance of the dreadfull Fire in 1666.
Bowles delin. et sculp. Published according to Act of
Parliament, 1752. Printed for John Bowles and Son,

being taken on Fish-Street-Hill, shews the Monument
on the left hand, and the termination of the
street in the first Northern gate of London Bridge,
with some indication of the houses beyond it; though
the whole view has certainly a far more spacious appearance,
than this part of London ever possessed.</p>

<p>“Before I close my notices of the year 1757, I
have to observe, from the printed document I have
so frequently quoted, that from 1639 until this time,
‘no addition of salary was paid to the Bridge-Masters,
nor any other allowance; but when the houses were
taken down on London Bridge, the sum of &pound;10 per
annum was ordered to be paid to each of the Bridge-Masters,
in lieu of fees, &amp;c. arising from the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
houses. Order of the Committee made May 4, 1757.
And also when certain warehouses were taken away,
and laid into the Bridge-House, the annual sum of
&pound;6. 10<em>s.</em> was ordered to be paid in lieu of the said
warehouses to the Senior Bridge-Master. And after
the Bridge was finished, lighted, and watched, one of
the Bridge-Masters was ordered to superintend the
Watchman on the said Bridge, and in the Bridge-Yard,
for which he received the sum of &pound;12 by order
of the Committee. The whole Income of the Senior
Bridge-Master at the present time (1786) &pound;100. 10<em>s.</em>

<p>“So terminates this very curious document, which
has furnished so many authentic particulars of the
Bridge accounts at different periods, shewing its
increasing prosperity and revenues, between the times
of Edward the Fourth, and those of George the Third.</p>

<div>
<p>“Whilst the alteration of London Bridge was being
carried rapidly into effect, in the early part of the
year 1758, an event occurred, which not only destroyed
some portion of the building itself, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
nearly the whole of the works surrounding it. This
was the fatal <span class="smcap">Fire on the Temporary Bridge</span>,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/540.jpg" width="437" height="500" alt="" title="Fire on the Temporary Bridge." />
</div>

<p class="pc">which burst out about eleven o’clock, in the night of
Tuesday, April 11th, as it is related in Entick’s ‘<cite>Continuation
of Maitland</cite>,’ page 20; in the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite>,’ volume xxviii., page 192; in John Noorthouck’s
‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ 1773, quarto, page 390;
and in Harrison’s ‘<cite>History of London</cite>,’ page 410, where
there is an engraving of the fire, probably by Wale,
after a drawing by Grignion. From these accounts,
we learn that the conflagration brake out suddenly
from the two ends of the Wooden Bridge, which, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
been dried by several days of bright sunshine,
appeared instantly to be in flames, entirely preventing
any approach to suppress it. Though Sir Charles
Asgill, the Lord Mayor, came very early to the spot,
and remained there almost the whole time of the fire,
exerting himself exceedingly to stop its progress, it
continued raging until the next day, when the burning
ruins fell into the river; and Entick observes,
that he saw the drawbridge a-light at twelve o’clock
at noon. All communication between the City and
Southwark being thus suspended, excepting so far
as it could be carried on by water, forty additional
boats were licensed by the Lord Mayor to work as
ferries on the three succeeding Sundays; though the
inhabitants of Southwark suffered still greater privation
from the destruction of the troughs which conveyed
water to them over the Bridge whilst it was
repairing, instead of the pipes which had been dug
up from the water-works. The navigation was also
equally interrupted by the vast timbers that fell
across the arches, and the many large stones which
almost blocked up the current of the tide; so that
the locks at each end only remained entirely clear.
As it was very generally suspected that this fire
was not accidental, the Lord Mayor waited on Mr.
Pitt by nine o’clock the next morning, by whom a
Proclamation, dated Whitehall, April the 12th, was
issued, containing the King’s Pardon to any of the
incendiaries, excepting the person who actually set
the Bridge on Fire; with a reward of &pound;200 for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
discovery, from the Corporation of London. From
the examinations of several persons, there appears to
have been considerable grounds for this suspicion.
The Watchmen and others in the vicinity, on both
sides of the river, declared that about eleven o’clock
they observed lights in several places under the
Bridge; soon after which, the whole building burst
into flames; and it was also reported, that about ten
o’clock, on the night of the fire, several persons, apparently
intoxicated, were seen coming over the
Bridge, with a torch, which, in a struggle between
themselves, was flung over the boarded fence, where
the light disappeared, till all the timber beneath burst
into flames. Another account, contained in the ‘<cite>London
Chronicle, or Universal Evening Post</cite>,’ for April
the 11th to the 13th, 1758, page 350, states, that the
Watchmen actually saw ‘a person in a boat with a
candle in a lanthorn, busy about the stone pier, which
is to be taken down to lay two arches into one; and
after a short time he was seen to extinguish the
candle, and the boat went off, and in a few minutes
after the Bridge burst out in flames, and continued so
until there was no wood left above the water to burn.’
The deposition, also, of Mary, wife of John Dennis, of
George Alley, Thames Street, taken before the Lord
Mayor on April 14th, stated, that about ten o’clock on
the night of the fire, she was in the Watch House
belonging to Dyers’ Hall, near London Bridge, and,
looking over the hatch of the door, she saw a lanthorn
in the Chapel pier. Soon after, she observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
another, and then, losing sight of both, there presently
appeared three in the same place. At first, she
supposed that some vessel was at the Bridge, but the
appearance of the second light shewed her that they
were between the wood-work at the great pier; and
when the three lanthorns were visible together, she
observed that one was held up and another down towards
the timbers. These lights she imagined to
proceed from workmen, but in a short time she saw a
small flame burst out on the same spot, which was
damped, and then brake out again, and, after having
been damped a second time, blazed very fiercely;
upon which the deponent went to the next wharf,
and gave notice that London Bridge was on fire.
This testimony of Mrs. Dennis was confirmed by that
of several other persons, who declared that they also
saw the lanthorns. The City was indeed filled with
rumours and suspicions of every description; the
lower orders accused the Watermen and Lightermen;
another class attributed the fire to the supporters of
the new Bridge at Blackfriars; whilst a third party
intimated that the scheme lay still deeper, and believed
the design to have been long concerted. We
know, indeed, that the Temporary Bridge was the
object of many an imprecation from the common
people, who might be tempted to fire it from the inconveniences
which they experienced upon it; as in
the Winter it was so excessively dirty, that some supposed
the Committee had contrived it so to increase
the toll, by obliging all passengers to cross it in carriages:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
whilst in dry weather it was no less incommoded
by dust. The real origin of the fire, however,
was never discovered; and Noorthouck observes, that
as there were enough of natural causes to have produced
it, so it is not probable that persons interested
in obstructing the works or creating new ones, would
have exposed themselves to detection for such an
attempt. ‘In such a mixture of stone and wood,’
says he, ‘a heap of quicklime on the sterlings, accidentally
wetted by the tide, might kindle any adjoining
timbers: or, as it is usual for servants behind
coaches, with flambeaux in their hands, to clear them
by striking them on the hinder wheels, it is no forced
supposition that some thoughtless fellow might have
struck his flambeau on the pallisade of the Bridge
for the same purpose; the flaming wax of which,
dropping into some joint on the outside, would have
been sufficient for such a disaster.’ A curious letter
on this subject, from which I have added many particulars
to my information, will be found in the ‘<cite>London
Chronicle</cite>’ for April the 13th to the 15th, 1758,
page 359. In consequence of this destruction, the
Corporation of London addressed the Parliament for
relief; and on Friday, April 21st, a resolution passed
the House of Commons, that ‘a sum not exceeding
&pound;15,000 be granted to his Majesty, to be applied
towards the rebuilding of London Bridge.’ This produced
the Act to which I have already referred, which
made any wilful attempt to destroy the Bridge or its
works, to be death without benefit of clergy.</p>

<p class="pc">presented a truly ruinous prospect; for nearly all the
centre houses being removed, there appeared a wide
vacancy, with a broken chasm in the middle, down to
the water’s edge, where the new arch was being constructed.
There are three engravings of this edifice
taken immediately subsequent to the destruction, the
rarest of which is an extremely slight and rude etching,
on a small folio half-sheet, entitled ‘<cite>The Melancholy
Prospect of London Bridge South-East, April
12th, 1758. J. Jump Del. et Sculp. Published according
to Act. To be had at the Acorn in the Strand.</cite>’
In this most barbarous prospect the buildings are represented
in flames; and I have seen it marked so
high as 4<em>s.</em> I cannot imagine why Gough, in his
‘<cite>British Topography</cite>,’ volume i., page 735, calls the
next of these engravings ‘a miserable view,’ since it
is certainly as good as the generality of the prints of
the period, and is very considerably better than the
last. It consists of a large half-sheet, entitled ‘<cite>An
Exact View of London Bridge since the Conflagration
of the Temporary Bridge</cite>,’ which is a copper-plate of
8 inches by 13&frac14;; and beneath it, in letter-press, is
‘<em>A Chronological and Historical Account from the first

Temporary Bridge, the 11th of April, 1758. Sold by

London Bridge. Price One Shilling, Plain. Colour’d,
Eighteen Pence.</em>’ The only additional information
which we derive from this narrative, is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span> ‘as the
wind providentially blew the whole time at East,&mdash;tho’
all the day before it had blown strong from the
Southward,&mdash;it did no damage to any of the houses
at either end.’ But by far the best representation of
the effects of this fire, is a half-sheet copper-plate,
entitled, in French and English, ‘<cite>A View of London

side of the Bridge, and represent the building horizontally
across the picture: Herbert’s extends from
Fishmongers’ Hall to the Southwark Gate; but Anthony
Walker’s takes in the whole Bridge, and part
of the buildings on the Surrey shore.</p>
</div>

<p>“Yet, if this fire were sudden, and its destruction
extensive, the exertions of the City Corporation were
not less prompt and effectual in repairing of the damage.
The Common Council, like Bunyan’s Captains
in <em>Mansoul</em>, being always true lovers of London, like so
many Samsons, shook themselves and came together
to consult upon and contrive a remedy. The Court
of Common Council met by one o’clock on the day
after the fire, and was attended by Mr. Dance, Mr.
Taylor, and Mr. Phillips, the builder of the Bridge,
whom the Lord Mayor had previously ordered to survey
it; and their report was, that with a proper number
of workmen, who should be allowed to labour on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
days, they would engage to make the old Bridge
passable for carriages by the 1st of May. A new
Temporary Bridge was ordered to be immediately
erected, and upwards of 500 workmen were constantly
employed upon it, by whose means, as it is stated in the
‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>’ for 1758, page 193, the Bridge
was re-opened for foot-passengers, on Wednesday,
the 19th of April; and the whole of the new wooden
edifice was ready for carriages in less than a month
after the fire. During the erection of this building,
there seemed to be discovered an additional proof
that the last conflagration was not accidental; for
Daniel Capel, the Inspector of the Bridge, having
been informed that Mary Dennis, before mentioned,
and John Scott, one of the Bridge Watchmen, had
seen lights about the new works at an unseasonable
hour in the night of the 23rd of August, brought
them to give their evidence before Mr. Alderman
Francis Cokayne. The Inspector was then ordered
to search if there were any appearance of fire, and
make his report to the Lord Mayor; upon which he
stated, that having carefully surveyed the Bridge
with proper attendants, they found the appearance of
an attempt in three places, where the new wood
work was scorched quite black; and one of the Watchmen
also produced the remains of a link found in the
unfinished works of the Bridge. To prevent another
conflagration, therefore, says Entick, in his ‘<cite>Continuation
of Maitland’s History</cite>,’ page 21, it was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
that two men, well armed, should be placed every
night, from sun-set to sun-rise, in a gallery erected
from end to end of the Temporary Bridge, just
beneath the centre of the works, with lamps lighted,
and a bell, to alarm the neighbourhood in case of an
attack. This watch was continued under the direction
of Mr. Capel, until the whole of the Temporary
Bridge was taken down. Before this, however, as
we are informed by ‘<cite>Owen’s Weekly Chronicle, or
Universal Journal</cite>,’ for August 26th to September
2nd, 1758, page 173, five watermen, armed with
blunderbusses and cutlasses, had watched for a fortnight,
from ten at night until five in the morning, in
a boat under the great Arch. The opening of the
second wooden erection for carriages did not take
place until Wednesday, the 18th of October, 1758,
as we learn from ‘<cite>Owen’s Weekly Chronicle</cite>,’ October
14th to 21st, No. 29, page 230: on page 206 of a former
number of which, the watch is particularly mentioned;
and we are also told that there was a convenient
pathway for foot-passengers, railed in and
elevated above the carriage-road. Pages 183 and
198 of the same authority, shew that the edifice was
strewed over with gravel above the planks; that on
each side there were uprights for covering it; and
that a month intervened between the gravelling and
the opening of the Bridge. In consequence, too, of
the recent attempt to destroy the New Bridge, this
paper likewise informs us, page 238, that orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
were issued by the Lord Mayor, that no coaches nor
foot-passengers should carry any lighted torches over
the Temporary Bridge.</p>

<div>
<p>“It was not, however, until the middle of the
year 1759, that the new Arch of London Bridge began
to assume its intended form; though we can trace
its progress only by slight occasional notices contained
in the periodicals of the day. Thus we learn
from a paragraph in the ‘<cite>London Chronicle</cite>,’ of
Saturday, July the 28th, 1759, page 88, that ‘the
grand Arch at London Bridge is now completed. It is
finished in the Gothick taste, and the ballustrades upon
it are fixing. The foot-paths will be rather wider
than those at Westminster; and it is proposed to fix
posts along them with chains from one post to the
other, to secure foot-passengers from any damage
which might otherwise happen from cattle.’ The
strength and complication of the timber used for
forming this Arch, are particularly pointed out in
an engraving and letter signed E. M., in ‘<cite>The London
Magazine</cite>’ for that year, volume xxviii., page 672;
where it is stated, that about 17,000 feet of wood
were contained within the arch, which, at some little
distance, appeared to be entirely solid, the vacant
spaces being exceedingly small in proportion to the
beams themselves. Its actual contents were 13,872
cubic feet of timber, forming the centre; and 3570
feet more occupied in booms, guard-piles, struts, and
trusses required for the preservation of the old and
new works, and for keeping off the River craft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
tide-water, and ice. This alteration was carried into
effect by Sir Robert Taylor, Architect to the Bank of
England, and Mr. Dance, Senior; and the Carpenter
employed for the construction of this <span class="smcap">Centring of
the Great Arch of London Bridge</span>,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/551.jpg" width="500" height="302" alt="" title="Centring of
the Great Arch of London Bridge." />
</div>

<p class="pc">received 2<em>s.</em> per foot for the use of his timber,
including labour, and took it back again at his own
expense. It measured 70 feet span, by 48 feet
wide, and the rise was 23 feet; it was formed of
16 ribs or frames, and was supported on three
Sterlings; namely, the two side ones of about 6 feet
each, and that from which the Chapel pier had
been removed. The author of the letter which I have
referred to, censuring the extraordinary quantity of
wood used in the centre, observes that it employed
nearly 10,500 feet more than were used at Westminster
Bridge; notwithstanding the Arch at London Bridge
is 4&frac34; feet narrower and 12 feet lower, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
Bridge itself is 4&frac34; feet wider. The author’s own
plan, which is also annexed to the letter, more resembles
that adopted by the late Mr. Rennie, in his
alteration of Rochester Bridge, in the year 1821.
It consisted of five radii, supporting as many timbers
placed pentagonally; occupied only 7000 feet of timber,
and would have amounted to &pound;1000 less than
the plan actually adopted.</p>
</div>

<p>“Many months had not elapsed, however, when
it was discovered, that, by the removal of the large
centre pier, the excavations around and underneath
its Sterlings were so considerable, as to place the
adjoining piers, and even the new arch itself, in very
imminent danger. The presentiments of many, and
the apprehensions of almost all, were consequently
so great, that but few persons would pass either over
or under it; the Surveyors themselves were not
prepared with any adequate remedy; and Mr. John
Smeaton, the celebrated Engineer, was instantly
summoned express from Yorkshire to relieve the
difficulty. Having immediately proceeded to survey
the Bridge, and to sound about the dangerous
Sterlings, he advised the Corporation to buy back
again the stones of the City Gates, and throw them
into the water, to guard the Sterlings; preserve the
bottom from farther corrosion; raise the floor under the
Arch; and restore the head of the current required
for the Water-works, to its original power. These
City Gates, you will remember, had been previously
sold and taken down, in 1760 and 61, as appears by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>’ for those years; volume
xxx., pages 390, 440, 591, and volume xxxi., page
187: where we are informed, that on Wednesday,
July 30th, were sold to Mr. Blagden, a Carpenter
in Coleman Street, before the Commissioners of City
Lands, the edifice of Aldgate for &pound;177: 10<em>s.</em>; Cripplegate
for &pound;91; and Ludgate for &pound;148. Two months
were allowed for the removal of each, the latter being
begun on Monday, August 4th, and Aldgate on
Monday, September 1st. Bishopsgate was sold on
Wednesday, December 10th; and on Wednesday,
April 22, 1761, Moorgate was also sold for &pound;166,
and Aldersgate for &pound;91. It was probably the materials
of the first of these, which lay in Moorfields,
when Mr. Smeaton advised their being thrown into
the Thames: and with so much promptitude was
that advice followed, that the stones were bought the
same day; horses, carts, and barges were instantly
procured, and the work commenced immediately,
although it was Sunday morning. These particulars
are related in the Life of this Engineer, attached to
his ‘<cite>Reports made on various Occasions</cite>,’ volume i,
London, 1812, quarto, page xix.</p>

<p>“Whilst we are speaking of this alteration of
London Bridge, it seems to be a proper place to say
something of the massive features of our ancient
edifice, and the oldest contrivances used for the support
of Bridges in general. First, then, the Piers
are said to be raised, so far as their nature can at
present be known, upon rough piles of oak and elm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
shod with iron, and driven very close, but apparently
not fastened. Upon the heads of these are frequently
found pieces of plank, chiefly oak, 4 to 6 inches in
thickness; and the insides of the Piers are filled up
with rubble laid in mortar. This kind of building
is supposed to have been anciently used when the
bed of the river could not be laid dry; and the stilts
or piles were then surrounded by a row of other
piles and planks, like a wall, called a Sterling or
Jettee, the vacant spaces of which were filled with
loose stones, &amp;c. to the top. The inconveniences
attending such a method are, however, so great, that
it is now entirely disused: as, on account of the
very loose composition of the Piers, they must be
made both large and broad, to prevent their entire
destruction upon drawing the centre of the Arch.
This great breadth, also, very materially contracts the
water-way, and incommodes navigation; whilst the
Sterling itself is in considerable danger of bursting.”</p>

<div>
<p>“But, Mr. Postern,” said I, as the Antiquary
arrived at this part of his narrative, “although
Maitland tells us, in his ‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., page 46,
and volume ii., page 1349, that the use of Coffer-dams,
or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caissons</i>, for building of the Piers of
Bridges, was first introduced into the Thames at
the erection of Westminster Bridge, yet it has been
supposed that even this of London was constructed
somewhat after the same plan; and that those
Sterlings are but the upper parts of the machines
themselves, left in the water to guard the Piers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
though it is certain, that in most of the Reports, illustrative
of the great repair of London Bridge, the
Sterlings are mentioned as additions to the original
structure for the support of the Piers. I have been
obligingly furnished, however, with an interesting
drawing, and extract from the MS. Journal of Mr.
William Knight, of Mr. Rennie’s office, by which we
are enabled to understand the construction of these
parts of the Bridge in a much clearer and more
perfect manner. Mr. Knight observes, that having
received several different statements as to the way in
which the Piers of the old London Bridge had been
erected, he determined upon convincing himself by
an actual survey. This he effected on August 14th,
1821, when an excavation was made for ascertaining
whether the original structure would support new
Arches of a larger span; and he then found it to be
built in the following manner. ‘The foundation of
the Piers on the North side,&mdash;between the Great
Lock and what is called the Long Entry Lock,&mdash;and
in the Sterling round it, appeared to be about 3 feet
above low-water mark. The bottom of the masonry
originally laid of the pier, is about 2 feet 3 inches
above low-water mark; and the first course is laid
upon a sill of oak, 16 inches wide, by 9 in thickness,
and perfectly sound. Immediately beneath this is a
mass of Kentish rubble, mixed with flint, chalk,
&amp;c., thrown in irregularly, but not mixed with any
cement. The masonry above the sill seems well
bonded together, with good mortar joints, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
are <em>no piles under the oak sill</em>. The external parts of
the pier seem to have been new-fronted at some
period,&mdash;probably at the time when the centre Arch
was formed in 1759,&mdash;as the base of this new fronting
projects about 1 foot before the original Pier. There
are <em>no piles under the original part of the Pier</em>; but to
the <em>new part there are some small ones driven into the
rubble</em>,&mdash;which can be of little service,&mdash;with some
planks laid upon their edges. The new masonry is well
bonded into the old work.’ Mr. Knight concludes,
by observing that, in all the accounts which he has
hitherto met with, the old Piers of this Bridge are
described to <em>stand upon piles</em>; but that, as he found
this to be erroneous in the present instance, he considers
it to be a fair conclusion that all the other Piers
were constructed upon the same principle. His
drawing represents a <span class="smcap">Section of the North Pier
of the Great Arch of London Bridge</span>,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

Great Arch of London Bridge." />
</div>

<p class="pc">shewing the original manner of constructing it, and
the Sterling, or ancient Coffer-dam, standing around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
it; which, it thus appears unquestionably evident
that, not having the art to pump dry, was filled
up with loose stones. The Arch on the right hand
is denominated the Long Entry Lock, and that on the
left is a part of the Great Arch in the centre. I
should remark also, that Mr. Knight has examined
several other parts of this edifice with no less care
and industry, in order to ascertain the plans adopted
at the famous alteration of London Bridge, of which
we are now speaking; of all of which observations
he has made interesting sketches and memoranda.
He states that he has felt with his measuring rods
the timber, &amp;c., placed in the river to strengthen the
piers of the Great Arch, and that his sounding leads
have been broken by catching in it. In April, 1826,
the opening of the roadway of London Bridge for
throwing of two more Arches into one, to increase
the water-way during the building of the New
Bridge, also made a curious discovery of many of the
more ancient parts of the original building. The
crowns of the old Arches, observes Mr. Knight,
were about 8 feet 6 inches from the present surface
of the ground, which appeared to have been raised
at different periods; and five several strata were
evidently to be traced over the centre of the original
Bridge, which was 20 feet in width. Immediately
over the crowns of the Arches was a layer of fine
gravel, about 20 inches in depth, perhaps the ancient
roadway, as its upper surface had the appearance of
being trodden down and dirty, when contrasted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
that beneath it. The next stratum consisted of mixed
chalk and gravel; the third of made ground of
various materials; the fourth, a thick layer of burnt
wood, ruins, and black earth; and the last another
bed of different substances, over which was the
granite paving. The filling-in between the Arches
was composed of chalk and mortar, of so hard
a nature that it was taken out with great difficulty.
With respect to the building itself, he observes, that
the stone of which the Arches were formed consists
of two courses: that of the soffits or flying ribs,
being Merstham Fire-stone, and the course above
very similar to the stone of Caen, or Normandy. In
the additions, or casings, on each side of the original
structure, Portland stone has been used, as well for
the facing, as for the Arches; whilst the backing and
filling-in, between the spandrils of the Arches, was
composed of chalk and mortar; which latter was
evidently of a very bad quality and carelessly applied.
Indeed, the ashler facing had been so little attended
to in the bonding of the work together, that it is
surprising, with the great weight behind, the careless
manner of throwing in the backing, and the slight
nature of the facing itself, that the whole work has
not been thrown outwards some time since. Having
thus, Mr. Barnaby, added these curious observations
to your narrative, I must once more entreat you to
proceed.”</p>
</div>

<p>“After making you my acknowledgments,” recommenced
the Antiquary, “for the very curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
illustration you have now furnished; and before
quitting the Great Arch of London Bridge, let me
observe, that it contains the Trinity Standard of
High Water, which is placed there for the benefit
of persons erecting buildings on the banks of the
Thames, and originally inscribed upon a metal plate,
affixed under the Great Arch upon the North East
side, as it may be seen beneath the centre Arch of
Blackfriars Bridge. It is at present engraven in the
centre of each Pier of the Great Arch, in black
Roman letters, about 7&frac12; feet above the springing line
of the Arch, or 8&frac12; feet over the sterling; and consists
of the inscription,&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox center">
<span class="smcap">Trinity.</span><br />
H. W.<br />
<span style="line-height: 2em;">1800.</span>
<hr class="short" />
<span lang="el" title="L">Λ</span>
</div>

<p class="pc">the character beneath being the average point of the
ordinary rise of a Spring Tide at High Water, which,
above Bridge, is 14&frac12; feet or 15 feet, being 5 feet
3 inches above the Neap Tides. At high Spring Tides,
however, it has risen 16 feet and upwards; and in
that remarkable one combined with a land-flood on
December 28th, 1821, it rose 2 feet, 10 inches, and
five parts, above the mark below Bridge. From the
official tidal observations of the Trinity Company, it
has been ascertained, that, from Blackwall to London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
Bridge, the High Water ascends to the same level; and
that from the upper side of London Bridge to that
of Westminster the River is likewise generally level,
excepting under the influence of winds or land-floods.
During that of 1821, to which I have just referred,
the banks of the River, and the marshes and gardens
above Westminster, were overflowed and damaged
to a very considerable extent; which has been attributed
to the obstruction offered by the present London
Bridge to the passage of the water towards the sea,
as we learn from the ‘<cite>Report of Ralph Walker, delivered
into the House of Commons, 11th of April,
1823</cite>,’ octavo, page 9; where he states, that the tides
below this edifice during the flood, rose only to the
ordinary height, whilst at Low water the fall was
increased by several feet. This celebrated fall is, of
course, most evident at Low water, when it is about
4 feet 6 inches, or 6 feet in the Winter season; and
the most hazardous time for passing through any of
the Bridge Locks, is probably half an hour previous to,
or, for barges, the last two hours before, Low water
below Bridge. The safest time of the tide is at
High water, or slack Low water: but boats may pass
with safety for 2&frac12; hours after flood, and the last half
hour of the drain of the tide at ebb, above Bridge;
the tide having then flowed nearly 4 feet below.
Deeply laden barges also take the drain through at
Low water. The Great Arch is doubtless one of the
safest to pass under, and is always used by craft and
barges; but before the erection of the New Bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
works, most of the other Locks were employed at the
flood tide, when the fall is extremely trifling. When the
tide is on the ebb, the Arches which are chiefly used
for boats are, the Draw-Lock,&mdash;the 4th from the Great
Arch,&mdash;on the South; and St. Mary’s Lock,&mdash;adjoining
the Great Arch,&mdash;on the North, which is always taken
on the first part of the ebb. The Long-Narrow, once
a favourite Lock, is now nearly abandoned; but the
Draw-Lock is perhaps considered the safest, and is the
most generally used since the erection of the New
Bridge Coffer-dams. The approach, however, is
dangerous, and requires a skilful waterman, who is
obliged to pull his boat into the draft or eddy of the
dam before he can make the Lock. Though the works
of the New Bridge have at present closed several of
the Arches of the ancient edifice, yet the 4th and 5th
Locks from the Southwark end have been thrown into
one, with a strong wooden vaulting, parapet, and
roadway above, to increase the water-way beneath.
Since the commencement of these works, the fall of
the river has also become less dangerous for barges,
from the returning tide sooner meeting with resistance;
and instead of a direct fall of 6 feet in 50, it
is now only about 6&frac12; feet in 250. The draft of the
tide, however, round the Coffer-dams, makes it very
difficult for lightermen to enter the Locks fairly; and
some of the outer rows of piles are driven inwards
from their barges being carried against them. In
1820 and 1822, the average fall at High water was
only from 8 to 13 inches; and in 1823, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
removal of the London Bridge Water-works, it
decreased to between 3 and 4.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barnaby! Mr. Barnaby!” exclaimed I,
fretted by this long digression in the Antiquary’s
narrative, “I protest you really put me out of all
patience: there’s no keeping you to one subject;
for the last of your annals referred to that most
wearisome alteration and repair of London Bridge
which began in 1757, and now you are bewildered in
a discourse on the navigation and tides of the Thames!
Truly, it’s intolerable!”</p>

<p>“I am aware,” replied the placid Mr. Postern,
whom there seemed to be actually no putting into a
passion, “I am aware how much these observations
serve to lengthen and interrupt our history; but still
they are vastly important to its illustration. ‘Our
life,’ says an interesting and romantic author, ‘cannot
be like an Arabian manuscript, all flowers and gold,’
and neither can history be composed only of the facts
which naturally belong to it. There must be various
incidental notices, seemingly unconnected with it,
which are at last found to combine with the story,
and to render it much more intelligible; and if ever,
Mr. Barbican, you publish these Chronicles of London
Bridge, make my words both your defence and your
apology. The fact is, I really am half unwilling
to proceed to the close of the alterations of this edifice,
because we have subsequently so few interesting particulars
on record concerning it; and other events,&mdash;excepting
the usual unhappy accidents beneath its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
Arches,&mdash;are almost entirely wanting. At the time of
the formation of the Great Arch, it appears that the
wooden Draw-Bridge was first taken away,&mdash;though
it had then long ceased to be used,&mdash;and the present
Stone Arch, entitled the Draw-Lock, about 30 feet in
width, or 16 feet between the Sterlings, was erected
instead of it. This we learn from the ‘<cite>Public Ledger</cite>,’
of Monday, January 28th, 1760, which states ‘that
the centre of the new Draw-Lock Arch of London
Bridge is struck; so that there is now a free passage
for boats, &amp;c.’ In this very Lock, however, only a
few months afterwards, an accident occurred which
might have almost proved fatal to the Bridge itself;
and it is thus related in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of
Monday, December 29th, 1760. ‘On Tuesday, a large
old French ship, that was coming through the Draw-Lock
at London Bridge, to be broken up above
Bridge, stuck in the Lock, and still continues there,
having done considerable damage to the same; and
it is thought that she cannot now be got out, but must
be broken up where she now lies.’ The same paper
for Friday, January 9th, 1761, states, that ‘yesterday
the workmen, who have been employed, for this
fortnight past, in breaking up the large French ship
that stuck in the Draw-Lock at London Bridge, as
she was going up the river, endeavoured, on the
strong flow of the tide, to get her through the Bridge,
but could not effect it. This ship, it appears, was
but 18 inches wider than the Lock.’ At length, however,
in the same paper for Friday, January 30th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
it was announced that ‘Yesterday the watermen
cleared the Draw-Lock at London Bridge, of the
large French ship that stuck there some weeks
ago.’</p>

<p>“The destruction of part of St. Magnus’ Church,
by most authors attributed to the year 1759, but
which actually took place in 1760, was the cause of
a further improvement of the North-East end of
London Bridge; by the opening of that arched
passage beneath the Church Steeple, which the
wisdom of Sir Christopher Wren had foreseen, and
provided for, fifty-five years before. This destruction
then, took place by a fire, which brake out between
9 and 10 o’clock, in the morning of Friday, April
18th, at the house of Messrs. Barrow and Reynolds,
Oilmen, in Thames street, adjoining to the Church.
It consumed seven dwelling-houses, all the warehouses
on Fresh Wharf, with a considerable quantity
of goods contained in them, and the roof of the
Church itself; which, falling in, very much damaged
the pews and altar-piece. The organ, the excellence
of which we have already noticed, was taken away,
but was considered to have received very serious
injury in the removal. The whole of this destruction
was estimated at &pound;40,000; and it was occasioned,
says Entick, in his ‘<cite>Continuation of Maitland’s History</cite>,’
page 29, by the neglect of a servant, who was
appointed to watch the boiling of some inflammatory
substances, and who left his charge on the fire,
whilst he went to see the famous Earl Ferrers return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
from his trial and condemnation. Before he could get
back, the whole shop was in flames. Some of these
particulars you will also find recorded in the ‘<cite>Public
Advertiser</cite>’ for Saturday, April 19th, 1760; and in the
‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>’ for that year, volume xxx.,
page 199. Before this fire, the main body of St. Magnus’
Church extended to the tower, which was originally
about equal with the houses on London Bridge; but
when they were taken away, the West end so greatly
interfered with the foot-path, that it was proposed to
take down so much of the building as enclosed the
tower on each side, and to form a passage under the
steeple by arches. This plan, however, does not
appear to have been proposed, until after the Church
had been repaired; because the first notice of it
which we meet with, is in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of
Monday, September 29th, 1760, in the following
terms. ‘The workmen have paved a great part of the
foot-path on the lower side of London Bridge; and
the tower part of St. Magnus’ Church has been lately
surveyed, in order to make some alteration in the
lower part thereof, conducive to the convenience of
the passage of the Bridge.’ The danger which was
supposed to be attendant upon its alteration, was
probably the cause of delay in its execution; but
the surveyor who was employed, had the ingenuity
to discover, that Sir Christopher, conceiving that
such a convenience must be required at some future
period, had contrived the arch on which the steeple
stood, of such strength, that it was essential only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
clear away the intermediate space to perfect the
alteration. Still the work proceeded but slowly,
since the next notice of it is contained in the ‘<cite>Public
Advertiser</cite>’ for Wednesday, August 4th, 1762. ‘The
North and West Porticoes adjoining to the tower
of St. Magnus’ Church at London Bridge, are taking
down, in order to form a passage to and from that
building, through the spacious arch upon which the
steeple is built; the South Portico is also down,
which fronts the Bridge, and makes a very agreeable
appearance; and the taking down of the West Portico,
to compleat that useful work, is in great forwardness.’
It was yet, however, almost another twelvemonth
before this improvement was perfected, as we learn
by the following notice, from the last mentioned
paper of Thursday, June 30th, 1763. ‘On Saturday
last,&mdash;25th,&mdash;the foot-passage under the arch of St.
Magnus’ steeple was opened; which, besides the convenience
for foot-passengers, makes a very pretty
appearance. A vestry, built of stone, is to be erected
in the Church-yard, to front the new Toll-house, just
erected at the corner of London Bridge.’ Before we
finally part with St. Magnus’ Church, I must not
forget to state, that Malcolm, in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Londinum Redivivum</cite>,’
volume iv., page 31, observes,&mdash;though without
citing his authority,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span> ‘in October, 1713, the
Rector received an anonymous letter, which discovered
a design of setting fire to London Bridge, for the
purpose of plundering the inhabitants. The greatest
precautions were adopted in consequence, and nothing
uncommon occurred.’ I find, however, no notice of
this letter in any of the periodical prints of the
time.</p>

<p>“In the mean time, the alterations of the Bridge
itself were in continual progression; though all the
buildings were not even yet removed, and the Temporary
Bridge was still standing. The ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
for Thursday, December 25th, 1760, states that
‘notice has been given to the people on the West
side of London Bridge, to quit their premises by the
25th of March next.’ In the same paper, for Tuesday,
February 3rd, 1761, an advertisement announces, that
six houses on the West side of London Bridge, from
the North end of the Temporary Bridge to the Toll
House, were to be sold by auction at Guildhall, to be
put up at &pound;156: and in the paper for Wednesday,
February 11th, we are informed that those houses
were begun to be pulled down. In your notices, Mr.
Barbican, of the tokens issued by the tradesmen of
old London Bridge, you mentioned two who lived at
the sign of the Bear, at the Bridge-foot, which, perhaps,
was the building referred to in the following
passage contained in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of Saturday,
December 26th, 1761. ‘Thursday last, the
workmen employed in pulling down the Bear Tavern
at the foot of London Bridge, found several pieces of
gold and silver coin of Queen Elizabeth, and other
monies to a considerable value.’”</p>

<p>“By no means unlikely,” replied I, “and I may
also add, that at this period was probably removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
the house of the original manufacturer of Walkden’s
Ink-powder, with which we are still familiar. We
learn the situation of his dwelling by his Shop-bill,
an impression of which is in the possession of Mr.
Upcott of the London Institution, engraven on a
copper plate, measuring 6&frac14; inches by 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>. Within a
double line, and beneath an ornamented compartment
containing a Bell, is inscribed:&mdash;‘<em>Richard Walkden,

of mentioning another Shop-bill connected with this
edifice, communicated to me by Henry Smedley,
Esq.; and consisting of a copper-plate executed
about the latter end of the 17th century, representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
a circle surrounded by fruit and foliage, having two
Cupids standing at the upper corners, and containing
in the centre, two palm-branches, enclosing a Sceptre
surmounted by a Heart. Round the whole are suspended
lancets, trepans, saws, &amp;c., and beneath the
device is engraven, ‘<em>Samvell Grover, at the Sceptre
and heart on London bridge, who maketh all sorts of
Chirugeons Instruments, the best sort of Razors, pen-knives,
Scissers, and Lancetts: there are also the best
Hoans, and fine Fish Skin Cases</em>.’ You may remember,
Mr. Postern, that one of my former Shop
Bills was that of James Brooke, Stationer, ‘near the
Square on London Bridge,’ This Square was formed
in the first opening on the Bridge, above the 8th
Arch from the North end, called St. Mary’s Lock.
It was surrounded by massive iron rails, and Mr. J.
T. Smith, in his ‘<cite>Antiquities of London</cite>,’ page 26,
states, that when the houses were taken down, the
iron-work was bought by several inhabitants of the
Parish of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate, and placed upon
the dwarf wall on the Eastern side of the Church
yard, where it is yet to be seen.”</p>

<p>“I have again to offer you my thanks,” answered
the Antiquary, “for your very curious and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherch&eacute;</i>
illustrations; and we will now close up the year 1761
by stating, that we are informed by the ‘<cite>Continuation
of Maitland’s History</cite>,’ page 35, that on Monday,
February 2nd, the tide flowed so short up the Thames,
that at high-water there was not sufficient to cover
the Sterlings; so that several persons waded over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
both above, and a little below, the Bridge at low water.
We may, I think, fairly consider the history of <em>Old</em>
London Bridge terminated at this place; since the
alterations we have recently described, made its features
almost such as we now behold them. I should
not forget, however, that one of the last pieces of
poetry connected with it, was written by the famous
Anne Killegrew, celebrated by Dryden, and entitled
‘<cite>On my Aunt, Mrs. A. K. Drown’d under London
Bridge in the Queen’s Bardge: Anno 1641</cite>.’ You will
find it printed in Southey’s ‘<cite>Specimens of the later
English Poets</cite>,’ London, 1807, Octavo, volume i.,
page 15.</p>

<p>“As we are informed by the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
of Monday, June 7th, 1762, that the workmen had
then begun to lay down the iron pipes, for the conveyance
of water from London Bridge into the
Borough, we may conclude that the stone-work of
the edifice was then perfect; although from those pipes
leaking between the stones, there arose a report that
the new Bridge was falling to pieces, which was, some
years after, the origin of a particular inquiry.</p>

<p>“The destructive effects of some very high tides
which happened early in 1763, are the principal
events connected with London Bridge at that period;
as the ‘<cite>Continuation of Maitland’s History</cite>,’ page 48,
informs us that, on Tuesday, February 15th, the tide
rose to such a height in the River, that many parts of
Westminster were overflowed; and, below London
Bridge, the inhabitants of Tooley Street were obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
to keep to their upper rooms. In the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
of the following Thursday, it is stated that
the damage done to goods in warehouses adjoining
the Thames, was estimated at upwards of &pound;20,000;
the great land-floods having occasioned the water to
rise higher than it had ever been known. That the
Bridge itself was in some danger, may be inferred
from the same paper of Wednesday, February 23rd,
where it is recorded that ‘three engines are at work
driving piles, for the security of the large Arch of
London Bridge; some of the small ones, it is said,
will be entirely stopt, to prevent the water from ebbing
away too fast.’ It was probably this circumstance
that was alluded to by Mylne, the Architect, in his
Report to the Corporation of London, concerning a
new grant to the Water-works, made in June, 1767;
and which you will find in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
for Friday, July 17th. He there states, that in the
beginning of 1763, the first winter after taking up
the Pier from under the Great Arch, when the other
Arches were stopped up with ice, the whole force of
the tide rushed so violently through it, as to tear up
the bed of the river, and the Sterlings, being deprived
of their support, gave way, and left the foundation-piles
entirely exposed to the water. He adds, too,
that only to repair this damage, the sum of &pound;6800 was
expended by the Bridge Committee. Mr. Smeaton’s
answers on the best manner of enlarging and improving
London Bridge, delivered on March 18th,
1763, may also be seen in the paper last referred to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
for Monday, July 20th, 1767, and subsequent numbers.
In the same journal of Tuesday, April 15th, 1763, it
had been related, that ‘the water in the Thames rose so
high on Sunday, that many houses on the Surrey shore
were two or three feet deep in water; and at Lambeth,
the long walk by the Bishop’s Palace was
overflowed, and boats were employed in the town to
carry people from house to house.’</p>

<p>“Although the famous winter of 1766-67 continued
with remarkable severity until January 16th, we find
but few particulars of it connected with London
Bridge; excepting that the ‘<cite>Gazetteer and New Daily
Advertiser</cite>’ for Monday, January 12th, states that
several of its Arches were then stopped by the ice,
and some accidents, which happened there, are recorded
in the subsequent numbers of the same
paper. In a notice of the proceedings of a Court of
Common Council on Wednesday, July 30th, 1766,
also contained in the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ of the following
Friday, it is stated that the Committee for conducting
the recent repairs of London Bridge, made the last
report of their works; in which they set forth, that
they had executed the several trusts reposed in them
by the Acts of Parliament which I have recited to
you, and at the same time rendered an account of the
money then owing for the alterations. Of these it is
observed by John Gwynn, in his ‘<cite>London and Westminster
Improved</cite>,’ London, 1766, quarto, page 120, <em>Note</em>,
that they amounted to nearly &pound;100,000, beside the materials
of the houses, many of which were new. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
adds, too, that the Bridge was rendered worse than it
had been, by the exceeding rapidity of the stream under
the Great Arch; and condemns both the appearance
and effects of the Water-works. Of the remaining
debt, then, the Court ordered that &pound;3000 in the Chamberlain’s
hands should be immediately paid; and that
bonds should be given for the remainder, not exceeding
&pound;12,000, redeemable by the City, and bearing
interest at 4 per cent. The Committee was then
dissolved, and the concerns of London Bridge were
again restored to that belonging to the Bridge-House
Estates.</p>

<p>“There seems, however, to have been but little
satisfaction given by the extensive alterations and
improvements of this edifice; for, at the very same
Court, a petition for relief was presented from the
Watermen’s Company, stating that the navigation
through the Great Arch of London Bridge was very
dangerous, from the two adjoining Arches on the
North side being stopped up; and vessels being caught
in the eddy it occasioned, received considerable damage
before they could escape, which had sometimes occasioned
the loss of life. It was soon discovered, too,
that the iron pipes belonging to the Water-works,
laid across the Bridge, had greatly injured the stone-work
and crowns of the Arches, by frequent leaking;
whilst the piers of the Great Arch were weakened,
and the current of the tide was altered, by a new
Arch being granted to the Water-works. These
particulars are noticed in the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ of Thursday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
October 23rd, 1766; whilst in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
for Tuesday, November 4th, and the former paper
for Saturday, November 22nd, a report is mentioned
of entirely removing both the Bridge and Water-works,
and greatly improving the whole of their vicinity.
In the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>,’ too, for Friday and Monday,
December 5th and 8th, the dirty and dusty state of
the Bridge is mentioned as arising from total neglect
of cleaning and watering it, though the usual advertisements
for their performance were then publishing.</p>

<p>“For the consideration and removal of these defects,
a very fair opportunity was now offered; a
Committee of the Proprietors of the Water-works
having presented a petition to the Corporation, for
renting, and erecting a wheel in, the 5th Arch at
the North end of London Bridge, which had been
referred to a Committee, to examine, and report
upon. This petition was read at the Court of
Common Council on Thursday, November 28th,
1765, as we learn by the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of the
following day; and you will find a copy of it in the
same paper for Friday, July 3rd, 1767, forming part
of a series of 13 official documents, on the subject,
inserted in that journal down to Thursday, July 23rd,
of the same year. I have already had occasion
slightly to notice these proceedings, of which you
may find several particulars in the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite>’ for 1767, volume xxxvii., pages 337, 407;
but I shall now give you some account of them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
these more authentic sources, and close up my history
of the Water-works with a short description of their
mechanism, and final removal.</p>

<p>“The petition alluded to, contains a curious historical
outline of the Water-works at London Bridge,
tracing their gradual extension from one to four of
its Arches; the leases of all which were to terminate
in the year 2082, being 500 years from the time when
the original grant was made, the remainder taking
only the unexpired term. The 1st and 2nd Northern
Arches were let for 500 years, from November 24th,
1582, at 10<em>s.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>; and the 4th Arch, from
August 24th, 1701, for 381&frac14; years, also at 10<em>s.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
annum</i>, and a fine of &pound;300. The lease of the 3rd
Arch, however,&mdash;formerly stopped up and let to a
Wharfinger,&mdash;did not commence until Michaelmas
day, 1761, when it was granted for the term of 321
years, at the old rent; though the Proprietors of the
Water-works had made proposals for it in 1731 and
1743, when it was unoccupied, the last tenant having
quitted it at Lady-day, 1718. These leases were the
more readily granted, as it was supposed that the
Water-works were a protection to the Bridge and the
vessels below it; whilst it was asserted that the
Arches they occupied were but very seldom used,
and the lessees covenanted to secure their engines by
piles, as well as to keep the Piers and Sterlings built
upon, in proper repair. Their fire-plugs, too, were
to be under the direction of the Committee of City-Lands;
the Works were not to rise higher than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
cellars of the buildings on London Bridge; and houses
in general, in the City and its liberties, were to be
supplied with water at 20<em>s.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>. In petitioning
for a fifth Arch, it was represented, that, notwithstanding
the great expense incurred for the Water-works,
the engine was yet inadequate to the furnishing
at all times a sufficient supply of water. The wheels
under the other four Arches would never act with
the same velocity as they did before the late alteration
of the Bridge; but as the 5th Arch stood nearer the
central current of the River, the continual flowing of
the tide would give the works additional power,
without being any obstacle to the navigation. On
the other hand, however, several counter-petitions
were presented from the Wharfingers and Lightermen,
stating the dangerous eddy at the Great Arch, arising
from the closing of those Arches called the Long Entry
and Chapel Locks, to give force to the current at
the Water-works; and praying that they might be
opened, the middle of the River kept free, or that
two Arches at the South end might be closed instead
of them. We have already seen, that these suits
made but slow progress; and accordingly we find
that the petition from the Water-works was first referred
to a Sub-committee by the Committee of City-Lands,
on Wednesday, December 4th, 1765; to the
Committee itself on Friday, November 28th, 1766:
and on Tuesday, December 16th, their Report was
delivered to the Court of Common Council. Before
these Committees, the Proprietors of the Water-works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
appeared on Tuesday, October 21st, and Wednesday,
November 19th, 1766; when the complaints of their
pipes leaking, and the navigation being endangered,
were stated, and remedies ordered to be provided.
They were also asked, whether they would undertake,
on forfeiture of their lease, ‘to keep their engine at
work during the times of dead high and low-water,
when their wheels lay still, provided they had leave
to raise their tenants 1<em>s.</em> yearly for every house.’
To this they ultimately agreed, the additional rent
being made 2<em>s.</em>; and to remedy the leakage of such
pipes as lay across the Bridge for the supply of
Southwark, it was proposed that they should be
entirely removed, the first Arch on the Surrey side
of the Bridge being stopped up, and a wheel erected
in the second, 10<em>s.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i> being paid for each,
whilst the Long Entry and Chapel Locks were to be
re-opened. Such then were the measures recommended
in the Committee’s Report, as being without
danger and of general benefit; but before they were
acceded to, these particulars were ordered to be
printed, and a copy sent to some of the most eminent
Surveyors of the time, Messrs. Brindley, Smeaton,
Yeoman, Mylne, and Wooler, whose answers were
read to the Common Council, on Wednesday, February
25th, 1767. At the same time, too, as we are
informed by the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ of the day following, the
Proprietors of the Water-works were heard upon the
subject of their alterations, though the decision was
referred to the next Court. The Engineers generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
agreed, that by opening the Long Entry and Chapel
Locks, taking away the water-pipes upon the Bridge,
erecting a wheel in the 5th Arch, and occupying the
farthest two on the Surrey side, the edifice and navigation
would be generally improved. Mr. Mylne,
however, recommended that the 5th Arch should not
be granted; but that so many Arches at the South
end should be wholly stopped, as would be equal to
compensate the Water-works for their loss by the
Great Arch; adding, that the pipes were slowly, but
certainly, ruining the Bridge; and that a Water-company,
then established in Southwark, should be
encouraged to supply the whole of the Borough.
The Corporation, however, did not yet come to a
decision, but on Friday, March 13th, 1767, the Town
Clerk was again ordered to solicit the Engineers to
re-consider the subject, and to point out the course
most proper to be followed. The second series of
answers, which was read at a Court of Common
Council, on Tuesday, June 23rd, chiefly confirmed
and referred to the former. Messrs. Wooler and Mylne
were, however, decidedly against any new grants
to the Water-works, of which they earnestly recommended
the removal, as well as the opening of the
closed-up Arches; proposing to substitute a horse,
or fire, engine, on both sides of the river, or closing
up three Arches on the Surrey shore. Mr. Yeoman
also recommended the taking away of the Water-works;
whilst Mr. Smeaton, considering that the
bed of the Thames had become so unequal that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
would require several centuries to restore its level,
argued that the stoppage of London Bridge was useful
both to the Water-works and navigation in general,
and that it remained only to employ the force of
water in the most beneficial manner. By his Report
the Corporation seems to have been determined;
since the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ of June 24th states, that Mr.
Mylne was examined, and, after a long debate, the
5th Arch was granted to the Water-works, upon the
conditions already mentioned: though there were,
subsequently, several disputes on points of law, and
particularly upon the power which the Corporation
had to grant away the passage of a navigable river.</p>

<p>“The ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ for Monday, Dec. 28th, 1767,
informs us that the two Arches adjoining the South
end of the Bridge were, at length, then stopped up,
and wheels preparing to be erected in each of them;
and on the 30th, most of the Locks at that part of
the edifice were entirely closed by the ice. It was
not, however, until the year 1770, as we are informed
in Concannen’s ‘<cite>History of Southwark</cite>,’ page 233,
that the Borough Water-works were perfected by the
erection of a Steam-Engine; though a part of the
machinery was originally erected on the River-banks
for the supply of Mr. Thrale’s Brewery, when it was
worked by horses. These works were then known
by the name of their proprietor, which was afterwards
changed for that of the Company which bought
them: and an engine erected, wherein the pressure
of the atmosphere acted upon the Steam-piston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<p>“I proceed now, Mr. Barbican, to give you some
account of the Water-works erected at the North end
of London Bridge, which were considered to be far
superior even to the celebrated hydraulics of Marli,
in France. You are already aware, that the wheels
beneath the Arches were turned by the common tide-water
of the Thames; the axle-trees being 19 feet in
length, and 3 in diameter, having 4 sets of arms, 8 in
each place, on which were fixed 4 rings, or fellies, 20
feet in diameter, with 26 floats of 14 feet long, and 18
inches deep. The gudgeons, or centre-pins, of these
wheels, rested upon brasses, fixed on 2 large levers
16 feet long, the tops of which were formed of arched
timber, the levers being made circular on their lower
sides to an arch, and kept in their places by 2 arching
studs fixed in a stock, through 2 mortices in the lever.
To the lower part of the arch on the lever, was fixed
a strong triple chain, the links attached to circles of
1 foot in diameter, having notches or teeth, to take
hold of the leaves of a cast-iron pinion, 10 inches in
diameter, with 8 teeth in it, moving on an axis. The
other end of this chain had a large weight hanging
from it, to assist in counterpoising the wheel, and to
preserve the chain from sliding on the pinion. On
the same axis with the pinion, were 2 cog-wheels;
one of 6 feet in diameter having 48 cogs, and another
of 51 cogs, each working in a trundle of 6 rounds:
on this axis there was also a winch, by which one
man could raise or lower the wheels as occasion might
require. Near the end of the great axle-tree, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
another cog-wheel of 8 feet in diameter, and 44 cogs,
working into a trundle of 20 rounds, 4&frac12; feet in diameter;
the axis of which was fixed in brasses at each
end of the lever before mentioned, and communicated
with iron cranks having 4 necks, each of which
raised an iron spear attached to levers 24 feet in
length. To the other ends were fastened iron rods
and forcing-plugs, working in cast-iron cylinders 4&frac34;
feet long, 7 inches in bore above, and 9 below, where
the valves were. These cylinders were placed over
a hollow trunk of cast-iron, with 4 valves in it, immediately
beneath them; and as one end of the trunk
was furnished with a sucking-pipe and grate going
into the water, they were each filled alternately, and
delivered their supplies through curved pipes into a
second trunk, furnished with an iron pipe, through
which the water was forced up to any height required.
These were, however, only half the works;
the whole of the mechanism being double to each
wheel. The first wheel in the Arch next the City,
worked 16 forcers; and in the third Arch were three
wheels, one working 12, the second 8, and another 16
forcers. Their utmost power of raising water was estimated
from four of the wheels, to be 2052 gallons per
minute; 123,120 gallons&mdash;being equal to 1954 hogsheads&mdash;in
an hour; or 46,896 hogsheads daily, to the
height of 120 feet, including the waste, which might
be considered as a fifth part of the whole. Every revolution
of a wheel, made 2&frac12; strokes in every minute in
all the forcers, the wheels turning 6 times in a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
at high-water, and 4&frac12; times at middle water; and it was
stated before a Committee of the House of Commons,
that in the year 1820, these Works supplied 26,322,705
hogsheads of water. It is usual to give Dr. Desaguliers
as the authority for these particulars, but I have abstracted
them from the ‘<cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>,’
already referred to; and they are also printed in Maitland’s
‘<cite>History</cite>,’ volume i., page 51, whence they have
been copied into almost every subsequent account of
London. After the grant of a fifth Arch to the Water-works,
about July 1767, an improved wheel was designed
by Mr. Smeaton, to be erected at that part;
of which two engravings and several particulars, together
with his remarks on the Water-engine, are inserted
in the Second volume of his ‘<cite>Reports</cite>’ already
cited, Plates ii.-iii., pages 27-30.</p>

<p>“I have in my possession a large and curious old
drawing, in colours, representing two elevations, and
a ground-plan of these Works and the Water-Tower,
executed before the grant of a fifth Arch, or the
erection of wheels at the South end of the edifice,
which is chiefly interesting, as shewing the courses of
the main-pipes then attached to every wheel for conveying
water to the various parts of London; which
were connected and furnished in the following manner.
Bishopsgate Main, supplied from the Wheels under
the 3rd Arch, and Western end of the 4th, called ‘the
Upper, and Borough Wheels:’ Cheapside Main, from
those under the second and 3rd Arches, called the
‘Three-Ringed, and Low Wheels:’ Aldgate Main,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
from those under the 2nd Arch, and the Eastern end
of the 4th, expressed by the same name: Fleet-street
Main, from a small Wheel in the 1st Arch, and another
at the Western end of the 4th, called ‘the Two-Ringed,
and Borough Wheels:’ Newgate-street Main,
from those in the 2nd Arch, and the Western end of
the 4th, or ‘the Upper, and Three-Ringed Wheels:’
Broad-street Main, principally from ‘the Low-Wheel,’
under the 2nd Arch; though it also derived
some water from that at the Western end of the 4th:
Grace Church-street Main, from those in the 1st and
2nd Arches, or ‘the Two-Ringed, and Three-Ringed
Wheels:’ Cannon-street Main, from ‘the Upper, and
Borough Wheels,’ or those beneath the 3rd and 4th
Arches: Thames-street Main, from a ‘Low Wheel’ at
the Eastern end of the 4th Arch; and the Borough
Main, from the proper Wheel, which was situate at
its Western extremity, forming ten sets of main-pipes
in all. At each end of the Bridge, round the
Western-sides of the Water-works, were wooden
platforms or galleries, occasionally decorated with
plants and flowers; and immediately over the Wheels
at the City end, were the work-shops belonging to
them. Their history is now, however, fast drawing
to a close: in March, 1817, the managers gave notice
that they were about to rebuild their largest Water-wheel;
but on July 26th, 1822, the third Year of King
George IV., an Act was passed for their entire removal,
with a view of improving London Bridge, or
erecting a new one. You will, of course, find this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
document in ‘<cite>The Statutes of the Realm</cite>,’ by John
Raithby, Esq., volume viii., London, 1822, quarto,
pages 1049-1054; it being chapter cix. of the ‘<cite>Local
and Personal Acts declared public</cite>:’ and I shall now give
you a slight idea of its contents. Having declared,
that about 260 years of the original grants to the
Water-works are yet unexpired, it is enacted that
the Corporation of London shall raise &pound;15,000 out of
the Bridge-House Estates, for carrying the Act
into effect; &pound;10,000 of which should be paid to the
Proprietors of the Water-works, for rendering void
all their licences, and transferring all their machinery,
buildings, &amp;c. to the New-River Company, which
Company was entitled to commence receiving rents
and defraying expenses connected with the Water,
from June 24th, 1822; and it was also licensed to
procure leave from the Corporation, to cut the River-banks,
&amp;c. below low-water mark, not exceeding
100 feet from the East side of the present Bridge, for
laying down pipes, &amp;c., saving the City’s rights in the
Thames; paying the sum of 20<em>s.</em> as a fine for so doing,
and 20<em>s.</em> annually afterwards. Full powers were likewise
granted, that the Company might lay down pipes
in the streets, and over the Bridges of London; and
that it might resign the supply of a part of a district
to another party, and receive a recompence in
return; adding that it should neither be compelled
to continue the supply, nor be considered to have an
exclusive right to it. Upon conclusion of the agreement,
the Company was to remove the whole machinery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
&amp;c. within the six months following, which
was otherwise to be taken up and sold by the Corporation.
The New-River Company was also charged with
the payment of certain annuities to the former Proprietors
of the Water-works, for the remainder of their
lease, as well as with the pensions due to their servants,
&amp;c. to be defrayed out of the rents received. Such, then,
was the end of the London Bridge Water-works;
and the only other remarkable event which I find recorded
in the year 1767, connected with our edifice
is, that on Saturday, November 28th, about 5 o’clock
in the morning, the tide ebbed and flowed at this
place, and at Greenwich, twice within an hour and a
half; as you will find recorded both in the ‘<cite>Continuation
of Maitland’s History</cite>,’ page 71, and in the
‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ for Wednesday, December 22nd.</p>

<p>“The year 1768 commenced with so violent and
general a frost, that its effects were felt equally upon
the land and the water. ‘It is said,’ observes the
‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ of Friday, January 1st, ‘that London
Bridge is in great danger by this severe frost: the
most essential of the piles which form the Sterlings
have been lately observed to be quite loose, and
playing in the water; and workmen have been ordered,
notwithstanding the imminent danger, to
throw Kentish rag-stone round the piers.’ In addition
to this, there were also several fatal accidents,
arising from the River being frozen, which were likewise
greatly detrimental to this edifice. The night of
Tuesday, January 5th, was said to have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
most fatal ever known for damage done upon the
Thames: one French vessel was thrown upon the
Sterlings of the Bridge, with the loss of her bow-sprit,
where it was obliged to be kept for several
days secured by ropes; and two others were driven
through the Centre Arch, losing their main-masts,
and carrying away the lamps from the parapet.
Some barges also got across the other Arches, and
after the breaking up of the frost, which was about
the middle of January, the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ of Thursday,
21st, states, that ‘yesterday a great many tons of
Kentish rag-stones were thrown under the Great Arch
of London Bridge, as a supposed temporary remedy
against the damage the foundation received during
the late frost. An expedient productive of infinite
ruin to the navigation, as they are soon scowered away
again, and an accumulating expense to the City of an
alarming nature.’ It is also added in the same paper
for Tuesday, February 2nd, that ‘the damages done
to London Bridge Water-works in the late severe
weather, are not yet repaired, though the workmen
have worked over hours, and on Sundays, ever since
the weather broke. The last damaged wheel will be
at work this week.’ It had been frequently remarked
in the papers of this period, that the amount of rents
received from the Proprietors of the London Bridge
Water-works, was not, in any degree, proportionate
to the expenses of their repairs, which were calculated
at &pound;2500 yearly; and in the ‘<cite>Gazetteer</cite>’ for Friday,
April 22nd, 1768, it is stated that they returned only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
&pound;3000 clear of all expenses. It is also rather curiously
observed, that ‘’tis computed that there are
drowned at London Bridge, about 50 people upon an
average every year; which, as they are the prime of
watermen, bargemen, and seamen, amount, at &pound;400
each, to &pound;20,000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>.’ The ‘<cite>Continuation of
Maitland’s History</cite>,’ page 73, states, that on April
10th, in this year, the Thames was so remarkably
low, that it was with difficulty even a wherry could
cross it, the sand-banks on both sides of the Bridge
being entirely dry. And now, as I have already
mentioned to you several particulars concerning the
foundation of Blackfriars’ Bridge, let me conclude
this year with a summary notice of its completion.
The Architect, then, was Robert Mylne, Esq.; the
first pile of it was driven in the middle of the Thames
on Saturday, June 7th, 1760; and the first stone was
laid by Sir Thomas Chitty, Lord Mayor, on Friday,
October 31st. On Wednesday, November 19th, 1768,
it was made passable as a bridle-way, exactly two
years after its reception of foot passengers; and it
was finally and generally opened on Sunday, November,
19th, 1769. The total expense of this building
amounted to &pound;152,840. 3<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em>; exclusive of &pound;5830
for altering and filling-up the Fleet-ditch, and &pound;2167,
the cost of the Temporary Wooden Bridge. Until
June 22nd, 1785, there was a toll of &frac12;<em>d.</em> for every foot-passenger,
and 1<em>d.</em> on Sundays; the yearly amount
of which, from its commencement in 1766, with the
purposes to which it was applied, may be seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
‘<cite>Second Report of the Select Committee for Improving
the Port of London</cite>,’ 1799, folio, <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 11, page
49. The Toll-house was burned down in the Riots
of 1780, when all the account-books were destroyed.</p>

<p>“And now to return again to our memorials of
London Bridge, I do not find, even after the most
careful search, any particulars of this edifice, connected
with the great Frost of 1785, notwithstanding
its extent and severity for 115 days; and for that of
1789, though there are many descriptions of its appearance
both up and down the River, there are but
few notices of it at this identical spot. The ‘<cite>Public
Advertiser</cite>’ of Friday, January 9th, 1789, states, that the
shipping below the Bridge was in considerable danger,
from the tiers at Deptford, Greenwich, &amp;c. being
enclosed with ice; and that the Thames being frozen
over on the day preceding, ‘several purl-booths
were erected, and many thousands of persons crossed
upon the ice from Tower-wharf to the opposite shore.’
The same paper for the day following, states, that the
frost had then continued for about six weeks; whilst
its severity down the River kept still increasing.
Passages across the ice, strewed with ashes, were
formed at Gun-Dock, Execution-Dock, &amp;c.; and these
parts seem to have constituted the principal scenes of
attraction. ‘No sooner,’ says the ‘<cite>London Chronicle</cite>’
from Saturday, January 10th, to Tuesday, January
13th, page 48, ‘had the Thames acquired a sufficient
consistency, than booths, turn-abouts, &amp;c. &amp;c. were
erected; the puppet-shows, wild-beasts, &amp;c. were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
transported from every adjacent village; whilst the
watermen, that they might draw their usual resources
from the water, broke in the ice close to the shore,
and erected bridges, with toll-bars, to make every
passenger pay a halfpenny for getting to the ice.
One of the suttling booths has for its sign ‘Beer,
Wine, and Spirituous Liquors without a License.’
A man who sells hot gingerbread, has a board on
which is written ‘no shop-tax nor window-duty.’ All
the adventurers contend in these short sentences for
the preference of the company, and the Thames is in
general crowded.’ Another specimen of the humour
exhibited at this place, was contained in the following
inscription on a temporary building on the Thames,
and printed in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of Thursday,
January 15th: ‘This Booth to Let. The present
possessor of the Premises is Mr. Frost. His affairs,
however, not being on a permanent footing, a dissolution
or bankruptcy may soon be expected, and the
final settlement of the whole entrusted to Mr. Thaw.’
On Wednesday, January 7th, a large pig was roasted
on one of the principal roads; and on Monday the
12th, a young bear was hunted on the ice, near Rotherhithe.
As usual, too, a printing-press was erected
near the same spot, of which there is a curious memorial
preserved in Mr. Crowle’s ‘<cite>Illustrated Pennant</cite>,’
volume viii., page 262, consisting of a bill, having
a border of type flowers containing the following
verses; afterwards altered and adopted in the Frost of
1814.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc"><cite>On the Ice, at the Thames Printing-Office opposite St.
Catherine’s Stairs in the severe Frost, January, 1789.
Printed by me, William Bailey.</cite>’ The same collection
also contains a small stippled engraving, entitled ‘<cite>A
View of the Thames from Rotherhithe Stairs, during the
Frost in 1789. Painted by G. Samuel, and Engraved
by W. Birch, Enamel-painter.</cite>’ The severity of this
frost, however, appears to have been felt considerably
beyond these scenes of amusement. The East-India
ships were hastily sent down to Gravesend, to which
place, and even below it, large shoals of ice had already
floated, extending almost through the whole Reach;
the navigation of boats was entirely stopped, and it
was supposed that the River would soon be completely
impassable from London Bridge to Woolwich. Vast
quantities of boiling water were poured every morning
upon the Bridge Water-works, before the wheels
could be set in motion, and 25 horses were daily employed
in removing the ice which surrounded them:
whilst at Blackfriars the masses of floating ice were
said to be 18 feet in thickness, and were continually
increasing from the many cart-loads of snow constantly
thrown over the ballustrades. ‘The various
parts of the River,’&mdash;says the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’ of
Friday, January 9th,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>‘present different appearances;
in some, the surface is smooth for a mile or two, and
then rough and mountainous, from the great quantities
of snow driven by the wind, and frozen in large
bodies.’ Towards Putney Bridge and upwards, the
scene on the ice again became really entertaining.
‘Opposite to Windsor-street,’ continues the same
paper, ‘booths have been erected since Friday last,
and a fair is kept on the river. Multitudes of
people are continually passing and repassing; puppet-shows,
round-abouts, and all the various amusements
of Bartholomew fair are exhibited. In short, Putney
and Fulham, from the morning dawn till the dusk of
returning evening, are a scene of festivity and gaiety.’</p>

<p>“At length, the expected thaw commenced with
some rain, about two o’clock on Tuesday, January
13th; and before night the streets were almost overflowed.
‘Perhaps,’ says the ‘<cite>London Chronicle</cite>,’ from
that date to Thursday, January 15th, page 56, ‘the
breaking up of the Fair upon the Thames last Tuesday
night below Bridge, exceeded every idea that
could be formed of it, as it was not until after the dusk
of the evening, that the busy crowd was persuaded
of the approach of a thaw. This, however, with the
cracking of some ice about 8 o’clock, made the whole
a scene of the most perfect confusion; as men, beasts,
booths, turn-abouts, puppet-shows, &amp;c. &amp;c. were all
in motion, and pouring towards the shore on each side.
The confluence here was so sudden and impetuous,
that the watermen who had formed the toll-bars over
the sides of the river, where they had broken the ice
for that purpose, not being able to maintain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
standard from the crowd, &amp;c. pulled up the boards,
by which a number of persons who could not leap, or
were borne down by the press, were soused up to the
middle. The difficulty of landing at the Tower
stairs was extreme, until near 10 o’clock, occasioned
by the crowding of people from the shore, who were
attracted by the confusion on the water. The inconvenience
to the shipping is now increased more than
since the setting in of the Frost, as no persons will
venture upon the ice to fetch or carry any thing for
them, and it is not yet sufficiently disunited for a boat
to live.’ The succeeding number of this paper, page
60, mentions that on Thursday, January 15th, the ice
was so powerful as to cut the cables of two vessels
lying at the Old Rose Chain, and drive them through
the Great Arch of London Bridge; when their masts
becoming entangled with the ballustrades, both were
broken, and many persons hurt. The Thames, however,
continued to be considerably frozen for some
time after this. I shall terminate the year 1789, by
informing you, that it is stated in the ‘<cite>Public Advertiser</cite>’
of Friday, January 16th, that the shares of the
London Bridge Proprietors, which some years before
had been worth &pound;3000 per annum in Life Annuities,
had then fallen below &pound;2000.</p>

<p>“In the years 1793 and 1794, the Great Centre
Arch again became a subject of consideration; for,
in order to confine the rubble which had been deposited
there to raise and preserve the form of its
bed, nine strong beams of timber were sunk in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
horizontally between the Sterlings, having upright
pieces at each end fitting into grooves cut in the sides
of the Sterlings, which forced them down and held
them in their places. This contrivance, however,
was only of temporary benefit, for, at the excellent
survey of London Bridge, made by Mr. George
Dance, in 1799, he supposed that only two of these
timbers were remaining, the rest having been carried
away by the ice. If we remember, indeed, the accidents
that were continually happening to the Bridge,
by vessels driving through it at this very part, there
can be no great reason to wonder at these defences
being speedily destroyed. So early as January 19th,
1795, we find by ‘<cite>Dodsley’s Annual Register</cite>’ for
that year, volume xxxvii., page 3 of the ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>’
part, that, about 12 o’clock, two vessels broke from
their moorings a little below the Bridge, when the
tide drove them violently against it. One of them
being a large West-Indiaman, making the Centre
Arch, had all its masts carried away close by the
board, when it drove through with a violent crash,
and continued up the river to Somerset House. In
1798, also, the same authority, volume xl., page
40 of the ‘<cite>Chronicle</cite>’ part, mentions, that on May
23rd, a sprit-sail vessel, laden with hay, drove against
the Bridge with great velocity, and the mast not
being lowered in time, it struck the ballustrades over
the Centre Arch and broke them away to the space of
nearly ten feet; the two persons on board being
killed by the stones. But if I were to record all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
accidents of this nature, which are contained in the
registers of every year, my narrative would be much
longer, and more melancholy, than either of us would
desire; and I shall add only, therefore, that even the
timbers, sunk as an improvement to the passage of
the Centre Arch, were found, in some degree, to injure
the navigation of the Bridge. For in the examination
of Mr. M. P.&mdash;now Alderman&mdash;Lucas, on June
26th, 1799, he stated, that the chalk, &amp;c. thrown into
the water to support the foundation of that part of the
Bridge, had produced shoals both above and below
it; and, that the timbers recently laid there having
prevented the rubble being scattered, it was stopped
up in the wake of the Great Arch, where it formed a
bar. On this account, the last three hours of the
ebb-tide, which were always attended with danger,
became additionally hazardous; empty craft under
3 or 4 tons burthen, could not go through with safety,
and loaded craft could not pass at all at that time.
The stream being then sunk below the level of the
Sterlings, the passage was reduced nearly one half;
the fall commenced and increased until the ebb was
over; a barge of 30 or 40 tons would consequently
pass with her bows under water, of which it frequently
shipped four or five tons; whilst it was impossible
for any one to stand upon the deck, without holding
on to some part of the vessel. Let me add, that you
will find all these particulars, together with a ‘<em>Plan
and description of the Timbers sunk in the Great Arch
of London Bridge, in the years 1793 and 1794</em>,’ in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>

to in the Second Report from the Select Committee
upon the Improvement of the Port of London</em>,’
1799, folio; and in the Appendix <span class="smcap-all">A</span> 5, <span class="smcap-all">B</span> 6, and pages
19 and 35 of the Report itself.</p>

<p>“As I do not find that the famous Frost of 1794
produced any very remarkable circumstance connected
with London Bridge, I shall hasten to the
year 1799, when it again became the subject of considerable
inquiry and speculation, the particulars of
which are so fully recorded in that Report to which I
have now referred you: pages 5 and 6, section 2,
and ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 1,-<span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 11, pages 21-49, plates v.-vii.
The amount of these proceedings was, that after a
minute survey of the Bridge and River, by Mr.
George Dance, Clerk of the Works, and Mr. John
Foulds, his assistant, and Engineer to the Water-works,
executed between the months of May and
July, it was ascertained, that, provided the Sterlings
were kept in repair, the structure itself was
likely to stand for ages. These defences, they added,
had then been recently altered and improved in shape,
size, and construction, so as to retain the chalk,
&amp;c. with which they were then filling; and though
there were many fractures in the building, they had
not increased in the last 30 years. The average
cost of its repairs had exceeded &pound;4200 annually, for
the last six years, and the Wardens’ receipts for the
same period had varied from &pound;9772: 2<em>s.</em> 1&frac12;<em>d.</em> to
&pound;24,848: 10<em>s.</em> 4&frac12;<em>d.</em> These financial particulars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
recorded at length in the Report whence we derive
our information; ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 10, pages 38-49, in
a document entitled ‘<cite>An account of the produce of the
Estates of the City of London, called the Bridge-House
Estates, and the application thereof, from the year 1756
to Christmas 1798</cite>;’ which may properly be considered
as a continuation of that paper which furnished
us with the ancient revenues and expenditures.
I should observe, however, that the Report still represents
the dangers of the Bridge navigation;
stating, that, although the stream was 10 feet deep
under the Middle Arch at low-water, yet, at the distance
of only a few yards below it, there were not
more than 18 inches. These Reports contain also the
following engravings.</p>

vi. in the same volume. The printed Report also contains
three other engravings connected with this
subject, from drawings made by Mr. Smeaton, to
illustrate his observations on London Bridge, in
March, 1763, and afterwards preserved by Sir
Joseph Banks, with the original manuscript of his
Report. They will be found at page 25, <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 5, of the
‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ and they consist of&mdash;1. ‘<em>Section of the
Water-way at London Bridge as it was before the
opening of the Great Arch, and at the beginning of
Feb. 1763</em>:’&mdash;2. ‘<em>Plan of the Sterlings of London
Bridge, before the opening of the Great Arch</em>;’&mdash;3.
‘<em>Plan of the proposed Water-way under the Great
Arch of London Bridge</em>,’ shewing the bed of rubble,
&amp;c. laid down for lining the foundation, and the additions
to the two centre Sterlings. All these engravings,
however, you will find reduced upon one plate, by
W. Lowry, and inserted in Smeaton’s ‘<cite>Reports</cite>’ already
cited, volume ii., page 1.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Geoffrey Barbican, though I am
rapidly advancing towards the end of my Chronicles,
like the tired post-horse, which exerts all his remaining
strength when he sees his resting-place is not
far distant, though I may not delay my course to enlarge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
upon any part of our subject, yet I think it not
only a fair opportunity, but a positive duty, to collect
all the omissions that I can remember from the
former part of my history; ‘unconsidered trifles,’ as
<em>Autolycus</em> says, and add them to the end of the 18th
Century, which is to us the great barrier between
ancient and modern times.</p>

<p>“And firstly, I would observe, that so early as the
year 1179-80, the inhabitants of the vicinity of London
Bridge appear to have formed themselves into several
of those fraternities anciently called Guilds; though,
having done so without lawful authority, they were
fined in various penalties. Whilst they all bore, however,
the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gilda de Ponte</i>, or Bridge-Guild,
we can only suppose that the members of them lived
in the Bridge-street, since the stone edifice had been
at that time no more than three or four years begun.
You will find these particulars recorded by Madox, in
his ‘<cite>History of the Exchequer</cite>,’ chapter xiv., section
xv., pages 390, 391, note z, and cited from the Great
Roll of the 26th year of Henry II.; the following
being those articles which immediately refer to the
present subject. ‘The Bridge-Guild, whereof Thomas
Cocus is Alderman, oweth 1 mark,’&mdash;13<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>: ‘the
Bridge-Guild, whereof Ailwin Fink is Alderman,
oweth 15 marks:’&mdash;‘the Bridge-Guild, whereof Robert
de Bosco is Alderman, oweth 10 marks:’&mdash;‘the Bridge-Guild,
whereof Peter Fitz Alan was Alderman, oweth
15 marks.’</p>

<p>“In speaking, too, of the reign of Queen Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
I omitted to mention that short notice with which
John Fox has furnished us, of certain ‘vaine pageants,’
exhibited to her upon London Bridge. You will find
the passage in the second volume of that edition of
his ‘<cite>Acts and Monuments</cite>’ which I have already cited,
page 1338, and it runs thus. ‘And the next day,
being Saturday, the xix. of August&mdash;1554,&mdash;the King
and Queene’s Majesties rode from Suffolk Place, accompanied
with a great number as well of noblemen
as of gentlemen, through the City of London to
White Hall, and at London Bridge, as he entered
at the Draw-Bridge, was a great vaine spectacle set
vp, two images presenting two Giants, one named
Corineus and the other Gogmagog, holding between
them certain Latin verses, which, for the vain ostentation
of flattery, I overpasse.’ I can discover no other
particulars of this exhibition, but the preceding
paragraph was copied, by Holinshed, into his ‘<cite>Chronicles</cite>,’
volume ii., page 1120.</p>

<p>“In mentioning the tradesmen who resided on
London Bridge, I ought, also, to have pointed out to
your notice that paragraph concerning them, first inserted
in Strype’s edition of <cite>Stow’s Survey</cite>, edit. 1720,
Book i.; chapter xxix., volume 1, page 242; where it is
said that ‘Men of trades, and sellers of wares in this
City, have oftentimes,’&mdash;since the days of Fitz Stephen&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>‘changed
their places as they have found to their best
advantage. For, whereas, Mercers and Haberdashers
used then to keep their shops in West-Cheap, of
later time they held them on London Bridge, where,
partly, they do yet remain.’</p>

<p>“One would expect to find frequent references to
London Bridge, in the works of our ancient Dramatists,
yet my memory supplies me with but very
few instances; though I may observe, that Shakspeare
has an allusion to the heads of traitors erected
over the gate of this edifice, in Act iii. Scene 2,
of ‘<cite>King Richard the Third</cite>,’ where <em>Catesby</em> says to
<em>Hastings</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘The Princes both make high account of you,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For they account his head upon the Bridge. &#8195; &#8195; &#8195; [<em>Aside.</em>’</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">Another passage, referring to this custom, is also to
be found in the second Act of George Wilkins’s
‘<cite>Miseries of Inforced Marriage</cite>,’ first printed in
quarto, 1607, and inserted in Dodsley’s ‘<cite>Select Collection
of Old Plays</cite>,’ London, 1780, duodecimo,
volume v., page 27; where <em>Ilford</em> says to <em>Wentloe</em>,
‘S’foot! you chittiface, that looks worse than a collier
through a wooden window, an ape afraid of a whip,
or a knave’s head, shook seven years in the weather
on London Bridge;&mdash;do you catechise me?’ In Act
v., Scene 1, of Shakerley Marmion’s ‘<cite>Antiquary</cite>,’
originally printed in 1641, quarto, and published in
the preceding collection, volume x., page 97, is likewise
the following passage, the idea of which appears
to be taken from the noisy situation of the houses on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
the Old Bridge: ‘That man that trusts a woman with
a privacy, and hopes for silence, may as well expect
it at the fall of a bridge.’ But ‘rare Ben Jonson,’ in
his ‘<cite>Staple of News</cite>,’ Act ii., Scene 1, has a reference
to those frequent, and almost useless, repairs of this
edifice, of which we have recounted so many; since
he makes <em>Shunfield</em> say of <em>Old Pennyboy</em>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘He minds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A courtesy no more than London Bridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Arch was mended last.’</span>
</div></div>

<p>“In William Gifford’s ‘<cite>Works of Ben Jonson</cite>,’ London,
1816, octavo, volume v., page 215, he has rather
a violent note upon this passage, in which he says,
‘Two hundred years have nearly elapsed since this
was written, and the observation still holds. This
pernicious structure has wasted more money in perpetual
repairs, than would have sufficed to build a
dozen safe and commodious Bridges; and cost the
lives, perhaps, of as many thousand people. This
may seem little to those whom it concerns, but there
is blood on the City, and a heavy account is before
them. Had an Alderman or a turtle been lost there,
the nuisance would have been long since removed.’
As I have already referred to the heads of the Regicides,
&amp;c. standing over the Bridge-gate at the time
of the Great Fire, I may observe, that ‘glorious John
Dryden,’ in his ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annus Mirabilis</cite>,’ stanza 223, has
this solemn mention of them, with a fine allusion to
the infernal hymns chanted on a Witches’ sabbath:</p>

<p>“In recording these analecta of Old London
Bridge, I may also take the opportunity of observing
to you, that from about July to September, you may
see almost every ‘jutty, frieze, and coigne of ’vantage,
made the pendent bed and procreant cradle’ of the
small yellow flowers and pointed leaves of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sisymbrium Irio</i>, or London Rocket. It probably
made its first appearance on this edifice soon after the
Great Fire of 1666, since the famous Botanist, Robert
Morison, who lived at the period, has a singular
dialogue upon it in his rare and curious ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pr&aelig;ludia
Botanica</cite>,’ printed in 1669; where he states, that in
1667-68 it sprang up in such abundance from the City
ruins, that in many places it might have been mown
like corn, though London Bridge is not specially referred
to. A coloured engraving of the plant, with
the foregoing particulars, will be found in William
Curtis’s ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flora Londinensis</cite>,’ London, 1767, folio.
Fasciculus vi., plate 48, marked 311.</p>

<p>“I have but few other fragments to mention; and
the first of them relates to the very extensive use
which is made of London Bridge as a thoroughfare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
What it must have been formerly, when it was the
only passage across the Thames, we know not; but
after the introduction of a toll, the rent at which I
have told you it was farmed, affords some general idea
of its importance. In July, 1811, however, when the
Southwark Bridge was projected, the Directors of
that Company attended one whole day, to ascertain
the probable amount of passengers, &amp;c. over London
Bridge; when it was found that 89,640 persons on
foot, 769 waggons, 2924 carts and drays, 1240 coaches,
485 gigs and taxed carts, and 764 horses, went across
it.</p>

<p>“But, to descend from the roadway to the foundation,
I shall next remark, that the natural soil of the
Thames, where the present London Bridge is erected,
consists chiefly of black gravel, for about 2 feet in
depth, below which it is gravel with red sand: and this
we learn from a table of ‘<cite>Borings of the River betwixt
London and Blackfriars’ Bridges, performed betwixt the
19th of May and the 16th of June, 1800, by John
Foulds and assistants</cite>;’ printed in the ‘<cite>Third Report</cite>’
of the Port of London Committee, ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ <span class="smcap-all">A.</span> 2,
page 39.</p>

<p>“Another point, connected with this part of the
edifice, concerning which I am very desirous of
giving some little information, is the etymology of the
word Sterling, or perhaps Starling, according to the
general pronunciation; yet what can I presume to say
upon it, when we find that, in the meaning of a defence
to bridges, it is unnoticed in the learned glossaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
of Somner, Minsheu, Stephen Skinner, Sir
Henry Spelman, John Jacob Hoffman, Du Fresne,
Edward Phillips, Francis Junius, Doctors Johnson
and Jamieson, and Archdeacon Nares? In the last
edition of ‘<cite>Dr. Johnson’s Dictionary</cite>,’ indeed, by the
Rev. H. J. Todd, this signification is inserted, though
the Editor candidly adds, ‘I know not the etymology;’
and, therefore, it seems alike futile to search after, and
presumptuous to conjecture it; howbeit, take what
hints I have met with upon the subject. And firstly,
in a small tract entitled ‘<cite>A short Review of the several
Pamphlets and Schemes that have been offered to the
Public, in relation to the building of a Bridge at Westminster</cite>,’
by John James, of Greenwich; London,
1736, octavo, at page 16, we find the following conjecture.
‘It is very probable, that the <em>Stallings</em>,&mdash;as
I choose to call them, our workmen after the Normans,
having, perhaps, taken the name from the French
word, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cr&eacute;che</i>, which signifies a manger, or crib in a stall,&mdash;may
have been much enlarged since the first building
of the Bridge.’ For my own part, however, I
am greatly inclined to think that the term is of
Northern origin, not very much corrupted, since the
Danish word <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">Staer</i>, and the German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Starr</i>, or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Starck</i>,
a defence, evidently appear to be the root of it; and
Christian Ludwig, in his ‘<cite>Dictionary of English,
German, and French</cite>,’ Leipsic, 1763, quarto, volume i.,
page 840, translates the word Starling by <em>Stahr</em>,
explaining it to be ‘a spur to the pillar of a stone
bridge, for dividing the water.’ It is common, in most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
Dictionaries, to consider the word Sterling as referring
only to that authorized coin, originally manufactured
by the Flemings or Easterlings, whose name it has
made immortal. Even in this sense, however, it is still
connected with the history of London Bridge; since
in Thomas Hearne’s ‘<cite>Collection of Curious Discourses</cite>,’
edit. London, 1771, octavo, volume ii., article xliii.,
page 316, is a paper on the derivation of the expression
Sterling Money, written by that eminent Antiquary
Arthur Agarde, containing a singular anecdote on this
subject; which, however, I shall give from the
original manuscript in the Cottonian collection,
marked ‘<em>Faustina</em>,’ <span class="smcap-all">E V.</span>, article 10, folio 52&#8201;a. ‘I
suppose,’ says he, ‘the name came by meanes the
Easterlinges from vs, being Germaynes, brought vp in
the mynes of syluer and copper there, were vsed here
in Englaunde for the reducynge and refyninge the
diuersyte of coynes into a perfecte Standarde. As in
the beginning of the Quenes Mat<sup>s</sup> raigne, they were
brought hyther by Alderman Lodge, (w<sup>th</sup> whom I was
famylyarlye acquaynted,) by her Mat<sup>s</sup> order, for the
refining of o<sup>r</sup> base coignes: And this he toulde me,
That the mooste of them in meltinge fell sycke to
deathe w<sup>th</sup> the sauoure, so as they were advised to
drynke in a dead man’s skull for theyre recure.
Whereupon he, w<sup>th</sup> others who had thoversyght of
that worke, procured a warrant from the Counsaile
to take of the heades vppon London Bridge, and make
cuppes thereof, whereof they dranke and founde some
reliefe, althoughe the mooste of them dyed.’ This wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
and romantic circumstance probably took place about
the year 1560 or 1561, when Queen Elizabeth had all
the base coin in the Realm brought to the Tower and
melted there; when it is supposed that the fumes of
the arsenic which it contained induced the illness of
the foreigners: see Ruding’s ‘<cite>Annals of the Coinage</cite>,’
which I have already quoted, volume iii., page 38, <em>note</em>.
When, to these particulars, I have added, that you will
find a view of part of Old London Bridge with the
houses, in the sixth plate of Hogarth’s ‘<cite>Marriage &agrave; la
Mode</cite>,’ my reminiscences of this edifice are concluded
to the end of the eighteenth century.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, well,” said I, fetching a long breath,
which sounded a good deal like a yawn, “I know
what you would say,&mdash;another libation of Sack, to the
memory of Old London Bridge; in the which I more
readily join you, seeing that your history of it is
rapidly closing, and that we are something like the
Merchant Abudah, in Ridley’s Tales of the Genii,
when he first saw the distant light after his wanderings
in the murky caverns of Tasgi: though, indeed,
Master Barnaby, I should ask you, on your veracity,
if we really are coming to a conclusion, or am I only
deceiving myself in thinking so?”</p>

<p>“No, truly,” answered the Antiquary, “I have but
little more to speak, and you but little to hear; for,
excepting the usual accidents of London Bridge,
which I shall omit to notice, the great employment
of the last quarter of a century has been coming to the
resolution of building a new one, and considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
the best means of doing it. Whilst, however, I give
you my hearty thanks for your attention and assistance
during upwards of eight hundred years of
our Bridge-history, I would only remind you of the
great mass of information which we have collected
upon it, much of which was either never before
brought together, or adapted to it.”</p>

<p>“Why, really,” said I, with that kind of half agreement
with which men admit a truth not discovered
by themselves, “there is something in your remark;
and he who next writes the history of London Bridge
will have some difficulty in finding new materials for
it, at least in any ordinary authorities. But then, you
know, others, who are not acquainted with the mass
of matter relating to it, may accost us with the old
Italian saying of, ‘Where the Devil did you get all
this rubbish from?’”</p>

<p>“Out upon them for unthankful knaves, then,” replied
Master Postern; “let us console ourselves with
the thought that virtue rewards itself; and so, as I see
that you are again set in a position either for listening
or sleeping, I shall, for the last time, take up my tale.”
To this remark I nodded assent, and the old Gentleman
thus went on.</p>

<div>
<p>“The present century, Mr. Barbican, commenced
with some active exertions for the immediate erection
of a new London Bridge, upon the most extensive
and elaborate scale; of the numerous schemes for
which, however, I can give you little more than a
catalogue, referring you for full particulars to various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
parts of ‘<cite>The Third Report from the Select Committee
upon the Improvement of the Port of London</cite>,’ 1800,
Folio, and the large volume of engraved ‘<cite>Plans
and Drawings</cite>’ belonging to it. It is stated in sections
i. ii. of the former authority, pages 4-6, that the
great, continual, and ineffectual expenses of the old
Bridge, its irremediable insecurity, and the dangers of
its navigation, had induced the Committee to collect
information and provide designs for the building of a
new one. In this edifice it was proposed to construct
a free passage for vessels not exceeding 200 tons’
burthen, to that part of the River between London
and Blackfriars’ Bridges; where it was supposed,
upon examination, that they would always have a
depth of from 12 to 15 feet above low-water, formed
and maintained at only a slight expense after the
shoals had been cleared away. To ascertain the
number of ships which might be expected to use this
passage, the Committee procured an account of the
Foreign and Coasting Trade of London for 1799,
with the measurements of their masts, by which it
appeared that an Arch of 65 feet above high-water
mark, at medium Spring-Tides, would allow vessels
of 200 tons to pass it with their top-masts struck; and
that of Coasters under that burthen the number was
7248. Such, then, being the general design, the
Artists, who proposed sending in drawings, were
directed particularly to consider a convenient passage
over the Bridge, with as little acclivity as possible, as
well as its access to the principal avenues of London;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
to the attainment of these objects with the least interference
with private property; to the embellishment
of the Metropolis of London; and to the length of time,
and expense of the whole work. The designs presented
were of three different characters: being, firstly,
for a Bridge with a lofty Centre Arch, and a descending
causeway leading to some principal street on
each side of the River; secondly, for a similar Bridge,
having its approaches at right angles, and parallel to
the shores, to be raised on Arches on a new embankment
in front of the old wharfs, &amp;c.; and, thirdly,
for two Parallel Bridges, enclosing a space sufficient
for so many vessels as would probably pass in one
tide, their passage being through corresponding drawbridges,
one of which should always remain lowered
for the use of passengers. See the ‘<cite>Third Report</cite>,’
already cited, page 7; and having mentioned these
particulars, let us now take a glance at some of the
plans themselves.</p>

<p>“1. Mr. Ralph Dodd, Engineer, proposed the
erection of a stone Bridge of six Arches, 60 feet wide,
and a centre one of iron 300 feet span, and about 100
high, to admit shipping up the River; calculating that
the space between London and Blackfriars’ Bridges
contained 3,353,180 square feet, and would accommodate
nearly 1000 vessels. As this Bridge was to be
erected on the old foundations, and even to be built
in such a manner over the original structure as not to
interfere with the passage across it, it was to consist
of two separate tiers, somewhat in the manner of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
aqueduct, excepting at the Centre Arch; the lower
range consisting of small elliptical Arches lying
horizontally, and the upper,&mdash;which was to be about
100 feet high,&mdash;of segmental Arches. The whole
was to be adorned with an entablature and ballustrade,
statues, sculptures on the lower Piers, and
Corinthian columns above them; and its declivity to
extend from the upper corner of Monument Yard to
St. Thomas’s Street, Southwark, at an inclination of
about 2&frac12; inches in a yard. A pictorial elevation and
ground-plan of this design, with its relative bearing
to the old Bridge, are to be seen in Plates ii. and vii.
of the Plans and Drawings belonging to the Third of
the Port of London Reports. Vide also the ‘<cite>Report</cite>’
itself, section 3, page 7, and ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 1, page 49.</p>

<p>“This Plan, however, having led Mr. Dodd attentively
to survey the foundations of old London Bridge,
he became convinced of their insecurity and of its
impracticability, and referring to it only as a specimen
of its peculiar character, he sent the Committee another
design (2) for a highly decorated Stone Bridge, which
he proposed to be erected about 40 yards above the
ancient one, on the East side of Fishmongers’ Hall on
the North, and near Pepper-Alley on the South Shore.
It was to consist of five elliptical Arches, the centre
being 160 feet span and 80 feet high, the succeeding
two 140 feet span and 75 in height, and the outer two
120 feet span, and 70 in height; the structure was to
be raised 90 feet from high-water, and occupy 210
feet of the river, leaving 840 for water-way. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
whole was to be embellished with statues, columns,
&amp;c.; and the estimate for building it, including the
avenues, &amp;c. &amp;c. was &pound;350,000 for a Centre Arch of
80 feet; &pound;332,000 for one of 70 feet; and &pound;314,000 for
one of 60 feet; the erection to occupy five years.
An Elevation and Ground-plan of Mr. Dodd’s second
design are in the volume of Plates already referred to,
Plate iii.; and farther particulars will be found in the
‘<cite>Report</cite>,’ page 7, <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 1, page 51. These plans
are also farther illustrated by a pamphlet published
in 1799, entitled ‘<cite>Letters to a Merchant</cite>;’ for which
see the ‘<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>,’ volume lxix., part ii.,
November, page 965.</p>

<p>“3. The next design, upon the principle of a large
Centre Arch, was by Mr. Samuel Wyatt, constructed
wholly of cast-iron, with granite piers, and the bulk
of the superstructure filled up with chalk. This
Architect, however, sent only a model, without drawings,
plans, or estimates; see the ‘<cite>Report</cite>,’ page 8.</p>

<p>“4. The design furnished by Mr. Robert Mylne,
proposed that a Bridge of 5 Arches, the centre being
60 feet above high-water mark, and 150 feet wide,
should be directed towards the Monument, which was
to form the centre of a square, and terminate in a new
road into Kent on the South. The particulars of this
plan also propose a considerable improvement in all
the streets connected with the Bridge, as may be
seen in the ‘<cite>Third Report</cite>,’ <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 2, pages 51-56;
but it has neither estimates nor drawings.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas Wilson, Architect of the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
Bridge at Bishop’s Wearmouth, near Sunderland, furnished
a design (5) for one of cast-iron, with stone
piers, consisting of three large segmental Arches, the
centre one being 240 feet span, and 65 high, and the
two sides of 220 feet: the breadth of the road above
was to have been 45 feet; and his estimate for the iron-work
alone amounted to &pound;55,061. See the ‘<cite>Third
Report</cite>,’ pages 9 and 17, and <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">C.</span> page 76.
A large engraving of the Elevation and Sections is
also contained in the folio of Plans, &amp;c. Plate viii.
In section 4, article 9, page 14 of the ‘<cite>Report</cite>,’ the
Committee appears to have given a preference to this
design, with the side-approaches and improvements
of the shores by other Architects; it being supposed
that an ascent of about 2&frac12; inches in a yard would have
been sufficient for such a Centre Arch.</p>

<p>“The next three designs (6, 7, and 8,) were also
confined to Iron Bridges, and were furnished by
Messrs. Thomas Telford, Surveyor, and James Douglass,
Engineer, of which only one was published.
Their first idea was to diminish the ascent by increasing
the length of the Bridge on the Surrey side, and
by placing the largest arch nearest the City shore; its
dimensions being 160 feet span, and 65 rise. Their estimate,
including some extensive improvements along the
banks of the River, amounted to &pound;988,154; but this
design was particularly objectionable, both on account
of its unsymmetrical appearance, and the inconvenience
of its navigation; and in their subsequent plans,
therefore, they placed the great arch in the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
without any other material alteration. The estimate for
this was &pound;1,041,654; but their chief design (9) was
constructed on the principle of inclined planes gradually
descending at the sides on to the wharfs at
each end of the Bridge, and rounded for the convenience
of carriages. The edifice itself was to be of
iron, having an ascent of 2&frac14; inches in a yard, and was
to consist of five arches decorated with statues,
trophies, &amp;c., commemorative of the Naval Triumphs
of England, which were to give it the name of
‘Victory Bridge.’ The principal Arch was to be 180
feet span, and 65 high; and the lateral approaches
were to be formed upon wharfs gained out of the River
by embankments, and supported also by iron Arches,
having warehouses beneath them. As a protection to
the Bridge and its adjoining buildings, it was proposed
that all the Arches, but the centre, should be
closed at night by a chain; that in the spandrils of
the great Arch, watch-houses should be constructed;
and that the communications with the wharfs should
be cut off by gates. The site of this Bridge was
proposed to be the very line which the New one is
now taking, and the estimate for it was &pound;1,054,804:
see the ‘<cite>Third Report</cite>,’ pages 8, 9, 17, <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">B.</span>
3, pages 57-73; and Plates ix.-xii. in the folio
volume of Illustrations. The Report states that this
plan would prove, in some degree, the most speedy
and economical, and that it would interfere with
existing buildings less than the former; though it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
admitted that the turns to the ascent would be both
inconvenient and dangerous.</p>

<p>“Mr. George Dance, Architect to the City, and
Professor of Architecture in the Royal Academy, was
the only person who at this time furnished the Port
of London Committee with a design (10) for parallel
Bridges with Drawbridges for the passage of vessels;
and a single glance at the fac-similes of his drawings
in Plates xiv-xix. of the folio of Plans, &amp;c., will probably
be quite convincing as to their inconvenience.
The best idea of this peculiar design is, however, to
be gained from a large coloured bird’s-eye view of
the perfect edifice, drawn by the Architect, and engraven
in aqua-tinta by Thomas Daniell, dedicated to
Lord Hawkesbury, and published November 10th,
1800; a copy of which is in volume xiii. of Mr.
Crowle’s Illustrated Pennant in the British Museum.
It was intended to consist of two low level bridges,
one on each side of the present; containing six elliptical
Arches, having a drawbridge of two leaves in
the centre of each, flanked by four round towers
containing the mechanism for working them, and
signal-staffs for flags, or reflecting lamps, to announce
which of the passages was open. The space between
the Bridges was to be 300 feet wide, furnished with
mooring-chains, &amp;c. &amp;c., for securing the ships in
tiers, so as not to interrupt the passage of smaller
vessels. Each end of the edifice was to be formed
into a grand semi-elliptical area, surrounding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
Monument on the London side; and the estimate for
executing the whole was &pound;1,279,714; though Mr.
Dance also sent in two more contracted plans, one
amounting to &pound;968,677, and the other to &pound;807,537.
In speaking of his Double Bridge, I should observe
that he was led to the form of it by the great expense,
steepness, deformity, and inconvenience attendant on
an Arch high enough for the passage of vessels, which
he explained in a Drawing marked Plate xiii. in the
folio volume of Plans, &amp;c. The inclination of Ludgate-Hill
he found to be the steepest which he could
adopt for an Arch of 60 feet, and that would have extended
the approaches from East Cheap to beyond
Union Street. The principal objections made to this
plan were the great expense and delay connected with
it; that the shipping moored in the basin would be
exposed to a strong tide, with some danger; and that
whenever their number was considerable, it would be
difficult to provide for their uninterrupted passage,
as well as for that of smaller vessels. For all these particulars,
see the ‘<cite>Third Report</cite>,’ pages 9, 10, 17;
and the <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">D.</span> pages 77-81.</p>

<p>“Such, then, were the designs laid before the House
of Commons; and the Committee concluded its labour
for the year 1800, by recommending the rebuilding
of London Bridge of iron, with a centre Arch of at
least 65 feet above high-water. It was advised,
also, that the old edifice should remain till the new
one were completed; the place for erecting which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
opposite the West end of St. Saviour’s Church, as
being the narrowest part of the River, and having
buildings of the least value upon its banks, whilst the
Northern end should form a street to the Royal Exchange.
The removal of the Water-works was also
recommended; and the funds for carrying these works
into effect were proposed to be raised, firstly, by a
Bridge-toll on horses and carriages, which, it was
calculated, in 20 years would discharge a debt of
&pound;100,000; secondly, by a sum charged upon the
Bridge-House Estates equal to their annual expenditure,
which being taken at &pound;4200, in 25 years would
amount to &pound;105,000; and, thirdly, &pound;100,000 more were
to be raised by an additional debt on the Orphans’
Fund: this sum of &pound;305,000 being considered as more
than sufficient for erecting Mr. Wilson’s Bridge, and
making a proper compensation to the Water-works.</p>

<p>“Soon after the appearance of these resolutions,
but too late for publication in the Committee’s Report,
two other designs were presented, an account of
which was printed in a <em>Supplement</em> to it. The first of
these, see <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">H.</span> pages 143-147, consisted of a
design by Mr. James Black, Civil-Engineer, (11) for
a Bridge of Granite, with three elliptical Arches;
the centre being 230 feet span and 65 high, and the
sides having a span of 220 feet each: the inclination
was to be 2 inches in a yard, and the estimate,
&pound;294,089: 6<em>s.</em> Two folding engravings, consisting of
a Profile and Sections, will be found in Plates xxii.-xxiii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
of the Supplementary Illustrations of the folio
volume of Drawings.</p>

<p>“The other design (12) was by Messrs. Telford
and Douglass,&mdash;see <em>Appendix</em> <span class="smcap-all">I.</span>, pages 148, 149,&mdash;for
a cast-iron Bridge of a single semi-circular Arch
65 feet high, and 600 feet in the clear; the roadway
being 45 feet wide in the centre, and increasing to
90 feet at each granite abutment, to strengthen the
foundation, afford a greater space, and communicate
better with the inclined planes. The estimate was
&pound;262,289, and a very large engraving of it by Lowry,
comprehending an Elevation and Sectional Ground-plan,
with another outline of the ribs and framing,
form Plates xxiv. and xxv. of the Supplemental folio
Illustrations.</p>

<p>“In consequence of this last design, the attention
of the Committee was directed to the consideration of a
metal Bridge with one Arch; and on their meeting in
1801, a series of Questions was transmitted with this last
plan to Dr. Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal; the
Rev. A. Robertson, Savilian Professor of Geometry
at Oxford; John Playfair, Professor of Mathematics
at Edinburgh; John Robeson, Professor of Natural
Philosophy at Edinburgh; Dr. Milner; Dr. Charles
Hutton, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich;
Mr. Atwood of Knightsbridge; Colonel Twiss, of Woolwich;
Mr. William Jessop, of Newark; the late Messrs.
John Rennie and James Watt; Messrs. John Southern,
of Soho, Birmingham; William Reynolds, of Coalbrook-Dale;
John Wilkinson, of Bradley in Staffordshire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
Charles Bage, of Shrewsbury; and General Samuel
Bentham, Inspector General of the Naval Works of
the Admiralty; whose answers for an Appendix to
the ‘<cite>Report of the Select Committee</cite>’ for 1801: Nos.
1-16, pages 9-83. For the Questions themselves, see
pages 4-7 of the <cite>Report</cite>; they were 21 in number,
and inquired the nature of pressure and gravity in
such a Bridge? whether it would be strengthened by
increasing towards the abutments? how the weight
should be distributed to make it uniformly strong?
what weight it would bear? and what force would
overturn it at any particular part? concerning the
form of the Arch, and how to improve it? the importance
of models and experiments? the means of
keeping ships in the centre of the stream? the proportionate
strength of the abutments? the possibility
of constructing centering for it, without obstructing
the ordinary navigation? the nature, power, dimensions,
and method of casting the metal and cement to
be employed? how the design might be improved and
rendered more durable? and whether the estimates
equalled or exceeded the execution of the works?</p>

<p>“It was probably the very great diversity of sentiment
prevailing in the answers to these inquiries,
which caused this design to be ultimately abandoned;
for though its practicability, magnificence, and excellence,
were universally admitted, yet there were
so many doubts as to the actual strength and cohesion
of cast-iron, the power of the crown of the Arch, the
possibility of making the structure as one self-dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
frame, and of fortifying the haunches without
overloading them, that few of the returns agreed with
each other throughout. Drs. Maskelyne, Hutton, and
Mr. Rennie, recommended an elliptical arch; Professors
Robertson, Playfair, and Robeson, a circular
one: some considered increasing the width of the
roadway at each end of great importance; others proposed
making it still wider; Professor Robeson
thought it not very essential; and Professors Playfair
and Robertson conceived that it took away from the
strength of the whole. Dr. Hutton, Mr. Robeson,
and Mr. Watt, supposed that the gravity of the Bridge
would of itself be so great, that any additional weight
would be trifling; and that the mast of a ship striking
it, would break only that particular part, without
damaging the rest, though repeated shocks might in
time destroy it. For its construction, however, cast-iron
of the soft-grey kind, or rather gun-metal, was
generally preferred, as well as liquid iron for a
cement; which some practical persons considered as
not adapted for the purpose, and only advised the
whole to be well fitted together. The papers of Col.
Twiss and Mr. Watt recommended that the Bridge
should consist of three arches; and with that of Mr.
Southern was sent a drawing,&mdash;Plate xxvi. in the
folio of Plans, &amp;c.&mdash;of his method of more securely
constructing the arch and frame-work.</p>

<p>“The return sent in by General, afterwards Sir
Samuel, Bentham, see ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ No. 16, page 76-83,
instead of considering the lofty Bridge of Messrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
Telford and Douglass, was occupied by detailing a
new design, (13) engraven by Basire, on Plate xxvii.,
in the folio of Illustrations. Its principal characteristic
was an enlargement in the centre, into a sexangular
form of more than twice its ordinary breadth,
having in the middle an octagonal basin, spacious
enough for a ship to lie in, without touching a Drawbridge
constructed in each side; which Drawbridges
were to be 30 feet wide, and so contrived, that either
should be sufficient for a temporary passage; and
the vessel having passed through one, it was to be let
down and fixed, before the other was opened. The
edifice itself was to be of granite, on a rise of an inch
in a yard, and to have eight segmental arches, with
the Drawbridge-passage in the centre, guarded by
four low round towers for the machinery: the estimate
was &pound;210,411.</p>

<p>“The ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ No. 17, pages 83-85, contains an
additional paper from Mr. Wilson, giving a farther
account of his design, and of a model which he had
constructed of it; and concluding with an estimate
of &pound;163,496 for the whole work.</p>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>“An interval of several years now occurs before
we meet with any farther proceedings concerning
the erection of a New London Bridge; which I shall
fill up with some notices of the engraved views of
the present edifice, and a few memoranda of the
other modern Bridges built over the Thames. The
prospects of this part of London are extremely numerous;
since it has not only frequently been delineated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
in separate prints, but is also to be found in
almost every volume which treats of our metropolitan
history. Perhaps some of the best representations
are those drawn by Joseph Farrington, R. A., about
the latter end of the last century, and engraven by
F. C. Stadler to imitate the originals. One of these
is a large folio, and the other will be found in Boydell’s
‘<cite>History of the River Thames</cite>,’ London, 1794,
folio, volume ii., plate 16, page 226. A small neat print
of London Bridge is also contained in Samuel Ireland’s
‘<cite>Picturesque Views of the River Thames</cite>,’ London,
1792, octavo, volume ii., plate 24, page 221: but etchings
of an infinitely superior class, by William Bernard
Cooke, are in his beautiful work of ‘<cite>The Thames</cite>,’
London, 1811, octavo, volume ii., plates 16 and 18. Two
of the most recent views of this edifice were published
in Charles Heath’s ‘<cite>Views of London</cite>,’ 1825, octavo,
both taken on the Eastern side, by W. Westall and
P. Dewint. A perspective elevation of the Bridge,
shewing the obliquity of its arches, and a curious
section of the River bed, also on the Eastern side,
surveyed by Mr. Ralph Dodd, is inserted in the folio
volume of ‘<cite>Plans, &amp;c., belonging to the Third Report
of the Port of London Committee</cite>,’ Plate vii.: and the
same Engineer has likewise given a large and interesting
print of the ‘<em>South Pier of the Great Arch of
London Bridge</em>,’ exhibiting the two chasms in it, the
iron clamps which hold it together, and a section of
the water-way. See Plate vi. of the same volume,
and the <cite>Report</cite> itself, ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’ <span class="smcap-all">B.</span> 1, page 52.* A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
similar representation was furnished by Mr. Mylne,
and is marked ‘<em>Drawing</em>, <span class="smcap-all">C.</span>’ on Plate i. of the same
illustrations: it consists of a profile through the
middle of the Great Arch, taken at still low-water in
1767, and shows the excavations above and below
Bridge, made by the rushing of the current. The
remainder of this Plate is occupied by Tables of
Soundings, Measurements, &amp;c. at various points of
the River near this place; and ‘<em>A Section of the Locks
and construction of the Piers of London Bridge as ascertained
in taking up of the Pier under the Great Arch
in 1762</em>.’ See Drawing <span class="smcap-all">A.</span> Of this I have already
given several particulars, and in Mr. Mylne’s paper
belonging to it, printed in the ‘<cite>Third Report</cite>,’ ‘<em>Appendix</em>,’
<span class="smcap-all">A.</span> 1, page 26, he has a curious account of taking
up the Piers, and its consequent effects. He was at
that time occupied in erecting Blackfriars’ Bridge,
and a lighterman, named Parsons, employed under
him, having contracted for removing the Pier, consulted
him as to the best means of doing so. Having
examined the building, he advised his procuring some
powerful screws, used in raising the heavy wheels of
the Water-works, which were fastened to the heads
of the soundest and securest piles. They first drew
out a few from the outer row, and then some of the
original in the interior, when all the stone-work
which was worth preserving being removed, and the
remainder thrown into the River, the cross-ties of
timber and iron were loosened, and the whole Pier
soon fell into ruins. It was immediately carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
away by the impetuosity of the fall; for the other
piles being removed, the middle of the work was
borne off so suddenly as scarcely to allow of its construction
being examined and measured. The Arch
being thus opened, the danger at first anticipated
by Mr. Mylne soon followed; for the accumulated
volume of water drawn from all the other arches
acted so violently upon the River bed, as greatly to
increase the depth and force of the tide; whilst the
corrosion spreading to the old Piers of the new Arch,
attacked the stability of the Sterlings beneath them:
these defences being only 6 feet broad under the
haunches of the Arch, and so close to the Piers, that
there was neither room to make any substantial repairs,
nor sufficient space for a pile-engine to act.
It was in this difficulty that Mr. Smeaton advised the
City-Gates to be thrown into the River, for transferring
the deep water to the lower side of the Bridge;
an idea which he seems to have taken from Henri Gautier’s
statement concerning the Bridge of St. Esprit.
Mr. Mylne remarks, however, that the whole of
this advice not being followed, a farther quantity of
2000 tons of rubble-stone was recommended for the
construction of a new bed. And now, to come back
to my starting-place, and conclude my notices of
views of this edifice, let me remark that if you would
see it in all its interest, with the water rushing
through its Locks, and the building itself surmounted
and bounded by the Monument and the Spire of St.
Magnus’ Church, then the very spot for such a prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
is the <span class="smcap">Eastern Side of London Bridge</span>.</p>

<p>“I come next to perform my promise of giving
some account of the other modern Bridges of London,
and shall begin by reminding you that the proposal
for those at Westminster and Blackfriars was met by
a steady and violent opposition. This objection to
new Bridges appears, however, to have existed so
early as the year 1671, when it was first designed to
build one over the Thames at Putney; upon the
argument of loss to the Thames watermen, to the tolls
of London Bridge, and to the City of London, as
natural consequences. You will find all the particulars
of this subject contained in the Hon. Anchitell
Grey’s ‘<cite>Debates of the House of Commons, from the
year 1667 to the year 1694</cite>,’ London 1763, octavo,
volume i., pages 416-417: and it is singular, that in
this discussion the very places at which Bridges are
now erected, are mentioned as the most improper for
such edifices. The kind of prophetic objection which
runs through the whole debate has rendered it a very
amusing article for modern reading; and an ingenious,
but amplified, paraphrase of it was inserted in the
‘<cite>European Magazine</cite>,’ for September, 1825, <cite>New
Series</cite>, page 20-27. But even in the notes to the
Debates themselves, it is stated that ‘Experience has
at length convinced us of the weakness and fallacy of
the objections raised against another Bridge, though
private interest, it may be presumed, was the principal
motive: since, not to mention the many Bridges
that have been raised higher up the River, this Metropolis
now boasts,’&mdash;1763&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>‘without any of the
inconveniences, not only a Bridge at Putney, but
one at Westminster, where use and magnificence go
hand in hand; to which is adding a third at Blackfriars.’
The first of these modern structures was the
<span class="smcap">Vauxhall Bridge</span>, which was remarkable for having
had, in consequence of disputes, four Architects, Mr.
Ralph Dodd, Sir Samuel Bentham, Mr. Rennie, and
lastly, Mr. James Walker, who carried the design into
effect. It consists of nine arches of cast-iron, of 78
feet span, and 26 above high-water at spring-tides;
the first stone was laid by Lord Dundas, as proxy for
the Prince Regent, about 3 o’clock, on Thursday,
May 9th, 1811; it was opened in July, 1816; and its
cost amounted to upwards of &pound;300,000. The Strand,
or <span class="smcap">Waterloo Bridge</span>, was partly projected by Mr.
George Dodd, but wholly brought to perfection by
Mr. Rennie: it has 9 elliptical arches of 120 feet
span, and 36 feet above high-water at spring-tides;
the first stone was laid on the Surrey side of the
River close to Cuper’s Bridge, by the Chairman,
Henry Swann, Esq., and the Directors of the Company,
about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, of Friday, October
11th, 1811; the building amounted to about &pound;400,000;
and it was opened with great splendour by a procession
of the Prince Regent, and the Dukes of York
and Wellington, about 3 o’clock on Wednesday, June
18th, 1817, the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo,
when it received its name. The last was the <span class="smcap">Southwark
Bridge</span>, of which the first stone was laid by
the late Admiral Lord Keith, at 12 o’clock on Tuesday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
May 23rd, 1815, the Bill for erecting it having passed
May 6th, 1811. It consists of three immense Arches
of cast-iron, the centre being 240 feet in span, and
those at the sides 210, and about 42 feet above the
highest spring-tides: the whole work was estimated
at &pound;400,000; the Architect was the late Mr. Rennie;
and the edifice was opened by lamp-light on Wednesday,
March 24th, 1819, as the clock of St. Paul’s
Cathedral tolled midnight.</p>

<p>“I come now, Mr. Barbican, to speak of the last
Fair held on the River Thames, by London Bridge, in
the beginning of 1814. The Frost commenced with
a thick fog, on the evening of the preceding December
27th, which lasted for several days; followed by
heavier falls of snow than any within the memory of
man, and continuing for almost two days, with very
short intervals. During nearly four weeks’ frost, the
wind blew, with little intermission, from the North
and North-East; and the cold was intense. The
River was covered with vast pieces of floating ice,
bearing piles of snow, moving slowly with the tide,
or collected into masses wherever their progress was
obstructed. A thaw, which continued from January
26th to the 29th, floated so many of these down the
River, that the space between London and Blackfriars’
Bridges was almost impassable; and the
severe Frost, which recommenced the day following,
and lasted to February 5th, speedily united the whole
into one immoveable sheet of ice. Even on Sunday,
the 30th, some persons ventured to walk over it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
different parts; and on Tuesday, February 1st, the
usual entries were formed by the unemployed watermen;
particularly between Blackfriars’ Bridge and
Three Cranes’ Wharf, notices being written against
the streets leading to them, announcing a safe footway
over the River, by the toll on which, many of
them received &pound;6 per day. The standing amusements
of an English Frost Fair now commenced, and
many cheerfully paid to see and partake of that upon
the frozen Thames, which at any other time they
would not have deigned to look upon. Beside the
roughly-formed paths paved with ashes, leading from
shore to shore, there was a street of tents, called the
‘City Road,’ in which gay flags, inviting signs, music,
and dancing, evinced what excellent entertainment
was to be found there. That ancient wonder, peculiar
to the place, the roasting of a small sheep over a fire,
was exhibited to many a sixpenny audience, whilst
the provision itself, under the name of ‘Lapland
Mutton,’ sold for one shilling a slice! Several Printing-Presses
were also erected, to furnish memorials
of the Frost, in old verse, and new prose; and as I
have already given specimens of the ancient Thames’
printing, let us not pass over this last Great Frost
without recording a few of its papers.</p>

<p>“During the obstruction of this Frost, the tide did
not appear to rise above half its usual height; and
about the Bridge the ice lay in enormous blocks,
where their occasional splitting very much endangered
the edifice, and caused several accidents; one of
which forms the subject of a highly spirited etching
in Mr. J. T. Smith’s ‘<cite>Antiquities of London</cite>,’ page 24,
representing ‘<span class="smcap">An Arch of London Bridge</span>,</p>

<p class="pc"><em>as it appeared during the Great Frost, Drawn February
5th, 1814</em>.’ This is a North-East view of the
Prince’s Lock, or the 6th from the City-end; and is
particularly curious for shewing at once the modern
casing of the present Bridge, and the ancient edifice
beneath it. In the evening of Saturday, the very
day when this view was taken, Frost-Fair was visited
by rain and a sudden thaw, when the ice cracked and
floated in several places. On the following day, about
2 o’clock, the tide began to flow with great rapidity;
the immense masses of ice were broken up in all directions,
and the River was covered with wrecks; until
returning industry and the rushing current removed
every vestige of the last Frost-Fair. The features of
this British Carnival are in the memories of the greater
part of the present generation; though, if it were
otherwise, the representations of it are few and scarce,
and generally very inferior.</p>
</div>

<p>“It was, probably, the damage done to the Bridge
by this Frost, which again called the public attention to
its effectual improvement, by widening its water-way;
and in November, 1814, Messrs. George Dance, William
Chapman, Daniel Alexander, and James Mountague,
addressed a Report to a Committee of the Corporation,
for substituting four large Arches for eight of the
present. Their estimate amounted to &pound;92,000, supposing
the Piers to be strong enough to bear the increased
weight; which were to be examined by
Coffer-dams, each Coffer-dam amounting to about
&pound;20,000, additional; when, if the edifice should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
found too weak, the expense would be considerably
increased. By direction of the Corporation, one of the
Piers was opened, when Messrs. Chapman, and Ralph
and James Walker, were nearly satisfied as to the practicability
of the alteration; though Mr. Rennie’s confidence
in the structure was rather decreased. These
particulars are given at length in ‘<cite>An Abstract of the
Proceedings and Evidence relative to London Bridge,
taken from the Reports of a select Committee of the
House of Commons, the Journals of the Common-Council,
and the Committee for letting the Bridge-House
Estates</cite>,’ London, 1819, folio, pages 68-107:
and also in a Report of a Committee of the House of
Commons, printed in ‘<cite>Reports and Evidences relative
to London Bridge</cite>,’ 1820, 1821, folio, pages 49-52.
This Report candidly states the uncertainty and expense
of the whole plan, and earnestly recommends
the erection of a new Bridge, with not more than five
Arches, as near as possible to the site of the present:
adding, from the evidence of numerous witnesses,
the universal agreement on the decided advantages to
be gained from a free current of water, and that the
Water-works should certainly be removed, whether
the Bridge were altered or rebuilt. The annual rental
of the Bridge-House Estates, amounting to &pound;25,800,
and the property and stock of the Trustees, &pound;112,000
more, were conceived to be sufficient for the proposed
works; or that the remainder might be raised without
levying a toll upon foot-passengers.</p>

<p>“This Report is dated May 25th, 1821, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
strenuous reccommendation of a new building was a
natural result of the inquiries of the Select Committee
of the House of Commons, specially appointed
for that purpose; the Minutes of which are
printed in the ‘<cite>Reports and Evidences</cite>’ already cited,
pages 7-47. This examination of witnesses took
place in consequence of several Petitions from water-men,
owners of barges, &amp;c. relative to the dangerous
navigation of London Bridge, Mr. Heathfield being
agent for the Petitioners; and as the nature of their
complaint is generally known, I shall be very brief in
my account of it. They stated, then, that the craft,
&amp;c. on the River having increased one-third within
the last 20 years, the water-way at London Bridge
was no longer sufficient for them; since the larger
loaded barges, in general, went through the Great
Arch, which they could pass only for about 6 hours out
of 24, or the first 3 after high-water. On this account,
there was considerable danger at the flood-tide, because
the loaded barges, then crowding to get through,
were all equally impelled to the same point; and thus
very frequently damaged, sunk, or locked together in
the Arch. Another cause of great danger was the
getting on a Sterling, when the water had covered it
only enough to prevent its form being visible; for if
a barge passed over it but a few feet, or even inches,
and stopped upon not finding sufficient water, if it got
on the edge, as the water sank, it fell over; or, if in
the middle, was detained there until the next tide.
This evil, too, was stated to be continually increasing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
from the constant repairs of the Sterlings, which considerably
extended their size; whilst much of the
chalk, &amp;c. being daily washed over, served only to fill
up the Arches. For barges, however, not exceeding
25 tons’ burthen, St. Mary’s and the Draw-Locks were
both occasionally used at high-water; but, besides their
extreme narrowness,&mdash;neither of them being more
than 16 feet between the Sterlings,&mdash;they are both
subject to peculiar and contrary sets of tides; whilst
the Sterling of the former has so great a projection,
that a barge striking it would probably go stern foremost
into the 4th Lock, where it would be detained
the rest of the tide, and considerably damaged, or
sunk. Omitting the numerous accidents at London
Bridge recounted in these answers, I shall observe
only, that some of the Lightermen, &amp;c. estimated their
losses by it at &pound;100 yearly; and that Mr. Anthony
Nicholl, a Wharfinger at Dowgate, stated, that, having,
in April, 1820, lost goods there to the amount of
&pound;1000, he could not insure property passing through
the Bridge, under a premium of 5 per cent.</p>

<p>“Whilst this evidence, however, seemed decisive as
to the great importance of a new edifice, the Corporation
of London appears to have been much more
inclined to alter the old one; since, on February 22nd,
1821, the Committee for letting the Bridge-House
Estates was ordered to attend the Select Committee
of the House of Commons, during their deliberations
respecting London Bridge: and on the 22nd of the
ensuing March, the Select Bridge Committee was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
also directed to consider of the Report on altering the
structure, as proposed by Mr. Dance, &amp;c. The result
of the latter inquiry was given in a Report dated April
11th, contained in the tract of Documents already
cited, page 78; and it stated that, on March 30th, a
conference having been held with the Earl of Liverpool
and the Right Hon. Nicholas Vansittart, the
Committee, &amp;c. were informed that His Majesty’s
Ministers would not sanction the appropriation of the
public revenue towards the erection of a new Bridge;
though it was considered that tolls might be levied for
that purpose. From this interview, the Committee
was induced to recommend the alteration of the old
London Bridge, as all the proposed funds for building
a new one were either objectionable or wholly insufficient.
The Corporation of London having agreed
to this return, it was delivered to the Select Committee
of the House of Commons, where evidence
was being received on the part of the Corporation;
as contained in the tract of Documents before referred
to, <em>Appendix</em> No. 1., pages 53-129; the proceedings
lasting from Wednesday, March 23rd, 1821,
to Monday, May 14th, and the examinations on the part
of the City being conducted by Mr. Randle Jackson.
This evidence was divided into two principal parts;
the first being intended to disprove the allegations of
the petitioners respecting the inconveniences; and the
second, that the proposed alteration of the Bridge
would be both a practicable and sufficient improvement.
To ascertain whether the centre had undergone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
any recent or continued settlement, since the
great alteration of 1758, Mr. Francis Giles surveyed
it on March 6th, 1821, and found, by a spirit-level on
the cornice of the Great Arch, that the Western side
inclined only 2&frac12; inches below a right line of 83 feet,
whilst the variation on the East was no more than
2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches; and even this depression was supposed to
have taken place soon after the striking of the new
Arch, as there appeared neither crevices in the joints,
nor fractures in the stones, as indicating any later
sinking. The Sterlings and Piles were stated to be
in generally good repair, though the former had been
increased from 4 to 5 feet each at the Great Arch, to
make them of a more easy sweep, and form a smoother
passage for the current. To guard against any increase
of depth there, which might render the
Piles insecure, it was stated, that monthly soundings
were taken and registered, and large stones occasionally
dropped in, which were found to remain; but it
was not the custom to throw them in large quantities,
though the Sterlings of St. Mary’s and the 4th and
5th Locks had recently received about 153 tons of
chalk.</p>

<p>“These particulars were chiefly communicated by
James Mountague, Esq., Superintendant of the Works
at London Bridge, and Mr. John Kitching, the Tide-Carpenter;
but the most interesting and curious evidence,
which was intended to shew the nature and
amount of the Bridge-House funds, was given by
Robert Finch Newman, Esq., Comptroller of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
Bridge-House Estates; and embraced a great variety
of information relating to the history, property, and
officers belonging to this edifice. From his answers,
it appeared, that the real and personal property of
London Bridge produced an income of &pound;30,503: 7<em>s.</em>
8<em>d.</em>; out of which the rental of the Bridge-House
Estates amounted, in 1819, to &pound;23,990: 5<em>s.</em>, and in 1820
to &pound;25,805: 13<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> This rental consisted of ‘Proper
Rents,’ or those arising from premises within the City;
‘Foreign Rents,’ derived from places without London;
‘Quit Rents,’ which have been already explained;
and ‘Lands Purchased,’ or possessions formerly
bought of the Crown. Before the Reformation, we
have seen that some of these were subject to the expense
of certain religious services; and the ancient
estate at Stratford, producing a rent of &pound;409: 4<em>s.</em>, is still
charged with the support of St. Michael’s and Peg’s
Hole Bridges there, on which &pound;2,467: 8<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em>, have
been laid out since 1724; and &pound;50 per annum are paid
as a composition for repairing the causeway. It was
farther added, that the City was indebted to the
Bridge-House the sums of &pound;36,383: 4<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> in cash,
and &pound;9,000 in 3 per cent. Consols; whilst its capital
consisted of</p>

<p>“The next branch of the evidence was to shew the
practicability and advantage of the proposed alterations,
contrasted with the erection of a new Bridge;
Mr. Rennie’s estimate for which amounted to &pound;450,000,
including &pound;20,000 for a temporary passage, as it was
to be erected on the old site, with nearly the present
approaches. The crown of the principal Arch of this
structure was intended to be 29 feet 6 inches over
high-water mark, being 14 feet 3 inches more than
the present; and the quantity of stone for it was calculated
at 70,000 tons. The principal argument for
altering the old edifice was, that the Piers might be
examined at low-water, at a trifling cost, without
Coffer-dams, and in about a month’s time; on account
of the apparent strength of the fabric as discovered
in an excavation made in May, 1821, on the City
side of the North Pier of the Great Arch, about 14
feet from the Western front. There is a lithographic
print of this opening, by Mr. James Walker; and particular
descriptions of its construction are contained
with it, in the tract of ‘<cite>Reports and Evidences</cite>,’ as
given by that Engineer, Mr. William Chapman, and
Mr. Thomas Piper, Stone-Mason to the City, see
pages 87, 102, 111, and 127; but with its formation, as
examined in this very year by Mr. Knight, we are
already perfectly well acquainted. As it was found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
however, as he also stated, that, in all probability, none
of the Piers rested solely on Piles, they were considered
capable of bearing a much greater weight than the
present Bridge, though that was proposed to be lightened
in the alteration; and as the Piers of the Great
Arch supported the superstructure when the depth
under it was 24 feet at low-water, they were believed
to be perfectly equal to carrying it with a depth of
10, to which the River-bed was proposed to be levelled.
Mr. Chapman also stated, that though a new
Bridge would admit of greater perfection, yet that
the intended alteration might answer the purpose,
and the whole work be rendered secure, if the Sterlings
were kept in repair; though he thought they
might be both lowered and contracted. And should
this alteration prove even insufficient as to the water-way,
he considered that two new Arches might be
formed at the North end, giving an addition of 43
feet, for the expense of about &pound;20,000 each. This
alteration was expected to reduce the annual repairs
of the Bridge, from one half to two-thirds of its former
amount; and abate the quantity of the fall of
water from 5 feet to 3 inches: though the velocity
of the stream above Bridge would be thereby increased,
since a greater quantity of water would have to
run through in the same time; and as the tide would
flow higher, and ebb lower, the inclination of the
River’s surface would likewise be increased. This
inclination amounts at present to 6 inches in a mile,
or 1 foot between Westminster and London Bridges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
at low-water; and estimating it at double after the alterations,
it was calculated by Messrs. James Walker,
and Stephen Leach, Superintendant of Improvements
in the Thames Navigation, that its effect would extend
as far as Kew Bridge. They also supposed that
the water would ebb sooner from the wharfs, and thus
leave their barges less time afloat; from all which
circumstances, it seemed important that the River
should be artificially deepened, the shoals cleared,
and the whole navigation gradually prepared to meet
the effects of the enlargement of London Bridge.</p>

<p>“The last part of the evidence was intended to
prove, that the increased water-way would be more
than sufficient to satisfy the petitioners; but though
the owners of the Coal-craft were contented with this,
some of the Wharfingers still objected to the short
time their vessels could work, from the rapid flow of
the tide; and contended that the remaining six Arches
on the North would collect ice enough to block up
the River above the Bridge. From these examinations,
the Bridge-Committee was convinced of the
superior advantage of erecting a New Bridge, as expressed
to the Corporation in a Report dated April
12th, 1821; though, from the difficulty of raising
funds for it, unassisted by Parliament, on June 2nd,
another Report was made, stating that a Select Committee
having attended the House of Commons, it
had adduced evidence to prove the stability of the
Bridge; that the inconveniences complained of were
exaggerated; and that the proposed alteration was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
both sufficient and practicable: notwithstanding
which, however, the House of Commons’ Committee,
in its Report of May 25th, recommended a Bill for
a new Bridge to be presented early in the next Session.</p>

<p>“These proceedings were followed by a survey of
the Thames, from the present Bridge to Old Swan-Stairs,
made by appointment of the City, about August,
1822, and taken at low-water mark, when the
depth was found to vary from 9 feet to 33&frac12;; the
greatest being at 84 feet from the Sterlings, and the
least at 290. The measurements were taken by a
line divided into spaces of 12 feet by pieces of red
cloth, passing between two others; one being extended
from the Old Swan entirely across the River, and the
second from the Sterling-points at the Great Arch.</p>

<p>“To procure designs for a new Bridge, on June
15th, 1822, the Corporation advertised premiums of
&pound;250, &pound;150, and &pound;100, for the first, second, and third
in merit, which produced about an hundred drawings;
their inspection being referred, November 15th,
by the Bridge-House Committee, to John Nash, John
Soane, Robert Smirke, and William Mountague, Esqrs.:
whose answers were given in three Reports in December,
1822, and the following January, and the
premiums awarded to Messrs. Fowler, Borer, and
Busby; though one of the designs of the late Mr.
Rennie was that ultimately adopted. The rebuilding
of London Bridge was then officially referred to
Parliament by order of the Corporation, February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
19th, 1823, when a Select Committee, formed from
that for managing the Bridge-House Estates, provided
a Bill; though the measure was still a matter of
dispute, from the doubts existing of its effects on the
navigation, the expense which it would incur, and on
the designs already presented.</p>

<p>“On July 4th, however, 1823,&mdash;the 4th year of
George IV. Chapter 50,&mdash;the Royal Assent was given
to ‘<em>An Act for the Rebuilding of London Bridge, and
for the improving and making suitable approaches thereto</em>;’
which is printed in ‘<cite>A Collection of the Public
General Statutes</cite>,’ London, 1823, folio, pages 478-536.
It commenced by noticing the title of the Corporation
of London to be Conservator of the Thames, and
its right to the Bridge-House Estates for the benefit
of London Bridge; and after referring to the Acts
for its improvement and removing the Water-works,
the evils of the present building, and the expedience
of a new one, it then proceeded to give the following
powers, to remain in force for 10 years. To take
down, and sell the old Bridge; either leaving it till
the completion of the new one, or erecting a temporary
structure before removing it: to build a new
edifice of Granite, either on the present site, or within
180 feet Westward, with convenient approaches, according
to the designs of John Rennie, Esq., with any
alterations, being, with the Engineer and Contractor,
previously approved by the Lords of the Treasury;
the new building standing in the parishes where its
abutments are placed, and marking the extent of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
jurisdiction instead of the old one: to embank the
River in a straight line, from the centre of the abutments
of the present Bridge, to the distance of 180
feet West, and 110, East; to raise and lower, new
pave, alter, or stop up, streets, &amp;c. in the approaches;
and close them during the execution of the Act, to
the distance of 300 yards from the present edifice; to
land materials free of duty, and to occupy places for
storing them, also within 300 feet; to take down houses,
&amp;c. beside those entered in the schedule, upon recompense
being previously made; to occupy the burial-ground
of St. Magnus’ Church, providing another; to
set back houses on the Western side of Grace-Church
Street, Fish-Street Hill, and High-Street, Southwark,
between Lombard-Street and St. Margaret’s-Hill; to
sell, or grant leases of, ground not wanted, and apply
the produce to the purposes of the Act; to receive
from the Lords of the Treasury the sum of &pound;150,000;
additional funds being raised on credit of the Bridge-House
Estates by mortgages, annuities, bonds, &amp;c.; to
set apart the yearly sum of &pound;12,000 from the Bridge-House
rents, for payment of existing charges, and
expenses; and to form a sinking-fund for redeeming
the monies borrowed; the residue of the rents being
deposited with the Chamberlain, for paying of interest,
&amp;c.; the expenses of the Act, designs, &amp;c. being
discharged from other sums belonging to the Bridge-House
Estates. It was also provided, that the Corporation
should be answerable for the misuse of these
funds, a yearly statement of accounts being laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
before Parliament; though it is not to be liable for failure
of the rents, &amp;c. on which money is borrowed, for
damage occasioned by removal of the Bridge, nor for
the work being left unfinished, by the funds proving
insufficient. The Act closed with powers for appointing
Committees, with Clerks, &amp;c., to execute it, saving
interested persons; and with the usual clauses for
lighting, watching, making compensation for tithes,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The schedule of houses to be taken down
contained the particulars of 43 buildings on the City
side, and of 109 in Southwark.</p>

<p>“It being determined to retain the old edifice
till the completion of its successor, the site of the
new Bridge was fixed at about 100 feet Westward of
the present, St. Saviour’s Church standing above it;
though the perfect plan of its approaches can scarcely
yet be traced. The first Pile of the work was driven
near the Southern end of the old Bridge, opposite the
Arch called the Second Lock from the Surrey shore,
at the East end of the Coffer-dam, of which it formed
a part, on Monday, March 15th, 1824. About the
same time, too, the whole of the open spaces between
the ballustrades on the Western parapet of the present
edifice, were closely boarded up; as well as those
square recesses, open at the top, which would have
allowed spectators to climb upon the cornice. The
houses and other buildings abutting on London
Bridge on the Western side of the Borough High-Street,
were also rapidly sold, and some parts only of
the lower fronts allowed to remain.</p>

<div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span></p>
<p>“It might have been expected that, in excavating
the new foundations, several interesting antiquities
would be discovered, illustrative of London history,
and of the ancient Bridge in particular; though, if
we consider the impetuous rush of the River at this
place, it is not surprising that but few articles of value
have been yet brought up. The most numerous
have been, defaced brass and copper coins of Augustus,
Vespasian, and later Roman Emperors; Venetian
Tokens; Nuremburg Counters; and a few Tradesmen’s
Tokens, very perfect; though I have seen
none of persons dwelling on the Bridge itself. There
have also been found, an old red earthen pitcher, or
bottle, nearly perfect; various rings and buckles of
wrought and engraved brass, and silver; some very
ancient iron keys, and silver spoons; the remains of
a dagger which had once been engraven and gilt,
and an iron spear-head, engraven on the shaft; most
of which are in the possession of Robert Finch Newman,
Esq., the Bridge-House Comptroller; whilst
in the City Library, at Guildhall, are some ancient
carved stones with dates, found in taking down the
Arches of the old Bridge. There has also been discovered
a particularly fine bronze lamp, representing a
head of Bacchus, wreathed with ivy; standing upon
the neck, which is made flat, and on its forehead a
circular lid, raised by the two curling horns, whilst a
handle is attached to the back of the head. This
beautiful antique is in very excellent preservation.
One of the most interesting reliques, however, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
I have yet seen, is a small <span class="smcap">Silver Effigy of Harpocrates</span>,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/647.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="" title="Silver Effigy of Harpocrates." />
</div>

<p class="pc">which was presented to the British Museum, by Messrs.
Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell, of Ludgate-Hill, November
12th, 1825; and is preserved in the Hamilton
Room, No. xii. of the Gallery of Antiquities,
Case, No. 11, under the care of Mr. J. T. Smith.
The figure is about 2&frac12; inches in height, and one in
breadth, and represents the son of Osiris as a winged
boy, with his finger pointing to his mouth, as God of
Silence; the horns, emblematical of his mother Isis,
on his head; and at his feet his other attributes, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
dog, a tortoise, an owl, and a serpent twined round a
staff; by the number of which we may guess the
figure to have been made in Greece, after the time of
Alexander the Great. The style of sculpture is firm
and massive; and on the back is a strong rivet,
through which pass a large ring and a very delicate
chain of pure gold, crossing like four belts in front;
it being probably of that class of figures which
Winckelmann states to have been worn as amulets, or
the attributes of Priests.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“To proceed, however, with New London Bridge,
I should state, that, Mr. Rennie, senior, having died
in 1821, the works have been principally superintended
by his son, Mr. John Rennie; and that the builders,
who have contracted to erect it, are Mr. William
Jolliffe, and Sir Edward Banks; the original amount
of whose contract was &pound;426,000, and &pound;30,000 for
making alterations in the present structure; the whole
to be completed in six years, from March 2nd, 1824:
which contract is now increased to &pound;506,000, by the
addition of &pound;8,000 for a new set of centering for the
4th Arch; and of &pound;42,000 granted by the Treasury
in 1825, for making the Bridge 6 feet wider; namely,
2 feet in each foot-path, and 2 feet in the carriage-way.
The exterior of the edifice will be of three sorts of
Granite; the Eastern side being of purple Aberdeen;
the Western, of the light-grey Devonshire Haytor;
and the Arch-stones of both, united with the red-brown
of Peterhead: the heartings of the Piers being
of hard Brambley-Fall, Derby, and Whitby stone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
These materials are roughly shaped at the quarries; and
after being carefully wrought at the Isle of Dogs, are
finally dressed and fitted to their places, at the Bridge.
The Pier-foundations are formed of piles, chiefly
beech, pointed with iron, and driven about 20 feet
into the blue clay of the River, about 4 feet apart;
having two rows of sills, each averaging about a foot
square, and filled in with large blocks of stone, upon
which is laid a six-inch beech planking, bearing the
first course of masonry. The proposed form of the
Bridge is a very flat segment, the rise not being more
than 7 feet; and it is to consist of 5 elliptical Arches,
having plain rectangular buttresses, standing upon
plinths, and cutwaters; with two straight flights of
stairs, 22 feet wide, at each end. That on the Western
side, at the City end, will, however, cut so deeply
into Fishmongers’ Hall, that it is to be taken down,
the Corporation paying &pound;20,000 to the Company.
My narrative is now so near a termination, that I have
to add only a few notices concerning the Bridge-Officers,
and a more particular and exact account of
the measurements of the new edifice than has yet been
recorded. Which dimensions, from high-water line,
are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Officers of old London Bridge, and its estates,
are, firstly, Two Masters, or Wardens, who receive and
pay all accounts of the Bridge-House, oversee its concerns,
watchmen, labourers, &amp;c., summon and attend
the Auditors, and Committees, and meet the
Corporation on Midsummer and Michaelmas days.
The yearly salary of the senior is &pound;250, and a house;
and that of the junior, &pound;200, with &pound;86 for house-rent
and taxes: their incomes being further increased by
some trifling official fees. The Comptroller of the
Works and Revenues of London Bridge receives a
salary of &pound;300, with other emoluments; and attends
all Committees, keeping their journals, and preparing
their reports, leases, contracts, and all other documents;
he has also the custody of the records, &amp;c.,
and, being a solicitor, conducts all the Bridge-House
law-proceedings. The Clerk of the Works is occupied
as a general Architectural Surveyor, attending Committees,
arbitrations, &amp;c., and making surveys, valuations,
designs, and estimates. He superintends all
new buildings and alterations on the Bridge-House
lands, inspects the covenants and dilapidations of the
tenants; as well as the time and bills of the trades-men,
and the Bridge-House stores, of all which he
makes reports to the Committee: his yearly salary is
&pound;500. The Assistant Clerk at the Bridge-House resides
in the upper part of that building, with a salary of
&pound;200; assisting the Bridge-Masters in keeping and
copying their accounts. The Superintendent of the
Works at London Bridge overlooks and directs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
repairs, the measuring and examination of the articles,
and certifies their quantities, &amp;c., his yearly salary
being &pound;100. The Bridge-House Carpenter is foreman
of those works, with a residence and &pound;200 per
annum; he keeps the workmen’s accounts, and receives
and portions out building stores; he also sets up
marks on the Bridge-House estates, and repairs such
water-stairs as they support. The Bridge-House
Messenger is employed in summoning and attending
the Auditors and Committees; in delivering notices
to the tenants, and in various other duties at the
Bridge-House, his salary being 36 shillings per week.
To these officers is added a Collector of Rents of
Tenants at Will in St. George’s Fields, who resides in
a house belonging to the estate, and is paid by a commission
of 5 per cent. The manner of letting premises
pertaining to the Bridge-House, is, on the expiration
of a lease, to have them viewed by the Committee
and Surveyor; when, if the Committee and
tenant agree, it is so stated to the Common Council;
and, if not, the premises are put up to auction. Finally,
the Committee of Bridge-House Estates is
composed of a certain number of Aldermen, and a
Commoner from each Ward; but no payments exceeding
&pound;100 are made without the sanction of the
Common Council, a brief statement of the accounts
being annually laid before the Court, a copy of which
is sent to every member. The accounts and vouchers
are then examined by four Auditors, annually elected
by the Livery, to whom a report is made; the documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
being sworn to by the Bridge-Masters; and these
statements, fairly transcribed on vellum, are deposited,
one copy in the Chamber of London, and another in
the Muniment-Room at the Bridge-House. And now,
having observed, that these particulars were given in
evidence before a Select Committee of the House of
Commons, in April 1821, and are printed much more
at large in the tract of ‘<cite>Reports and Evidences</cite>,’ pages
72, 73, 135-138, here I conclude with a parting libation,
and many thanks for your long-tried attention.”</p>

<div>
<p>Such, then, were Mr. Barnaby Postern’s historical
notices of old London Bridge; in which the reader
may perceive, that he evinced a fair proportion of antiquarian
learning, and rather a large share of reading
and memory. When he had arrived at this period,
however, as I thought that my own information
would enable me to add some curious modern particulars
to his narrative, I addressed him with, “My best
thanks are due to you, worthy Sir, for your interesting
<span class="smcap">Chronicles of London Bridge</span>; for, although
you have sometimes been prosy enough to have wearied
a dozen Dutchmen, yet, by my patience and your
perseverance, the story is safely brought down to the
present day. You have steered it, slowly enough, certainly,
but surely, through all the intricate navigation
of the Record Rolls, and have carefully avoided several
of those rocks of error, upon which so many former
historians have been wrecked. And since the narrative
has now reached the building of a New London
Bridge, pray allow me, so long your grateful hearer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
to relate the ceremony of Laying the First Stone
thereof, from my own observation, sketches, and memoranda.”</p>

<p>“My very hearty thanks are your’s for that most
excellent proposal, Mr. Geoffrey,” said the old Antiquary;
“for I am now too far declined into the vale of
years, to describe modern ceremonials and festivities
with the spirit of a younger Citizen: whilst you are
‘not clean past your youth;’ having yet only ‘some
smack of age, some relish of the saltness of time in you;’
therefore the story, good Mr. Barbican, the story.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it, Sir,” replied I; “you shall have
it, and with all the skill I can; though, after your
highly-finished ancient historical pictures, my modern
delineations can appear only faint and imperfect.</p>

<p>“The Coffer-Dam, in which the ceremony of Laying
the First Stone took place, was erected opposite to the
Southern Arch called the Fourth Lock, and was constructed
of three rows of piles, planks, and earth, substantially
secured by timbers of great strength and
thickness; and when the day for performing it was
fixed, it was officially announced by the following
notice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">“‘<span class="smcap">London Bridge.</span> <span class="smcap">Mansion House</span>, 23rd May, 1825. The
Committee for Rebuilding the New London Bridge having appointed
Wednesday, the 15th day of June next, for Laying the First Stone
of the New Bridge, Notice is hereby given, that the Foot and Carriage-way
over the present Bridge will be stopped on that day, from
Eleven o’clock in the Forenoon until Four o’clock in the Afternoon.</p>

<p class="blockquot">‘By Order of the Right Honourable the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquot right">‘<span class="smcap">Francis Hobler.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">‘N.B. Southwark Bridge will be open free of Toll during the
above hours.’</p>

<p>“As the intervening space passed away, the preparations
for the ceremonial proceeded on a scale of
equal celerity and magnitude. A Steam Engine, with
a high funnel, was erected against the City side of the
Coffer-Dam, for exhausting it of water, an entrance to
which was made through a covered stone recess of
the old Bridge, on the Northern side of the Dam. The
rude and intricate walling of piles and other erections
now began to assume a more regular appearance; a
platform and flight of steps connected them with the
parapet of the old edifice; a broad raised passage surrounded
the area in the centre, and the whole was
covered with an awning, above which rose numerous
lofty flag-staves. These, then, were the earlier preparations
for this splendid water-festival; and now let
us proceed to recount the wonders of the day itself.
A finer and more freshly-breathing air was certainly
never abroad, than that which cooled the atmosphere
and blew out the gaily-coloured flags around old
London Bridge, on the morning of Wednesday, the
15th of June. At a very early hour, the workmen
began erecting the barriers, which were double, and
at a considerable distance apart. Across the whole
space of Fish-Street Hill, from Upper and Lower
Thames Street, and again at Tooley Street, there
stretched wide wooden railings, having a moveable
bar at each pavement, with an opening wide enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
for one person only; whilst the centre of the Street
was divided with posts and bars, allowing carriages
to pass between them also, but in single lines. Within
these, at each end of the Bridge, was erected a strong
screen of rough planks, about fourteen feet high,
having four gates, answering to the former foot-paths
and carriage-ways. So long as the barriers continued
open, the old Bridge was crowded with gazers; who
were especially collected opposite that part of the parapet
which was to form the grand entrance to the Coffer-Dam;
while on the roofs of the houses, and other buildings
in the vicinity, were platforms of seats, and awnings
preparing, which were afterwards crowded with
spectators; as well as the Monument, St. Magnus’
Church, the towers of St. Mary Overies’, and St. Olave,
Fishmongers’ Hall, and the Patent-Shot works. Many
scaffolds were also erected for the purpose of letting, the
prices varying from 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> to 15<em>s.</em> each, according to
their accommodations; and the following is a specimen
of their announcements. ‘Seats to be let for viewing
the Procession, No. 2, Bridge Foot, for Laying the
First Stone of the New Bridge. Tickets 7<em>s.</em> and 5<em>s.</em>
each:’ though more moderate exhibitions were set
forth in the words, ‘A full view of the whole works,
Admission 6<em>d.</em>’ Another bill of entertainment, also
issued on that morning, stated, that ‘This Evening,
Wednesday, June 15th, the Monument will be superbly
illuminated with Portable Gas, in commemoration
of Laying the First Stone of the New London Bridge,
by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor. Admittance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
Sixpence each, at Nine o’clock.’ And in the
evening a lamp was accordingly placed at each of the
loop-holes of the column, to give the idea of its being
wreathed with flame, whilst two other series were
placed on the edges of the gallery; though the wind
seldom permitted the whole of the gas to remain
lighted at the same instant.</p>

<p>“Long before the time appointed for the closing
of old London Bridge, the River and buildings around
it were fully occupied with visitors; the vessels were
decorated with flags; and crowded pleasure-boats,
some carrying bands of music, floated round the
Coffer-Dam. At eleven o’clock, the Bridge was begun
to be cleared, and that of Southwark opened, for the
first and only time, toll free. The various entries
were guarded by constables, who ascertained that
every person was provided with a ticket; and before
noon, this famous passage across the Thames had
so completely changed its character, that the very
striking contrast to its usual appearance must have
been seen to be appreciated. The building of the
New London Bridge having been entrusted to the
following Committee, the ceremonies of this day were
also placed under the same direction; the Members
being distinguished by painted wands, surmounted by
the Arms of London and Southwark. These were,&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Lord Mayor</span>, all the Aldermen, and Jonathan
Crocker, Chairman of the Sub Bridge-House Committee;
Robert Fisher, of the Ward of <em>Aldersgate
within</em>; John Lorkin, of <em>Aldersgate without</em>; Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
Favell, of <em>Aldgate</em>; Henry Hughes, of <em>Bassishaw</em>;
William Austin, of <em>Billingsgate</em>; James Davies, and
Sir William Rawlins, of <em>Bishopsgate</em>; William Mathie,
of <em>Bread Street</em>; John Locke, of <em>Bridge</em>; Richard
Webb Jupp, of <em>Broad Street</em>; Thomas Carr, of <em>Candlewick</em>;
Robert Slade, of <em>Castle Baynard</em>; Charles
Bleaden, of <em>Cheap</em>; Josiah Griffiths, of <em>Coleman Street</em>;
Charles William Hick, of <em>Cordwainers</em>; Spencer Perry
Adderley, of <em>Cornhill</em>; Hugh Herron, of <em>Cripplegate

James Ebenezer Saunders, of <em>Dowgate</em>; Josiah
Daw, and Adam Oldham, of <em>Farringdon within</em>;
William John Reeves, and James Webb Southgate, of
<em>Farringdon without</em>; Joseph Carter, of <em>Langbourn</em>;
Thomas Price, of <em>Lime Street</em>; Robert Carter, of
<em>Portsoken</em>; William Routh, of <em>Queenhithe</em>; Peter
Skipper, of <em>Tower</em>; Thomas Conway, of <em>Vintry</em>; and
William Richardson, of <em>Walbrook</em>.</p>

<p>“The Tickets of admission to the Coffer-Dam were
also issued by these gentlemen, and were, of course,
in great request; but their number being limited, and
the general arrangements peculiarly excellent, there
was ample accommodation for even a more numerous
company. The Tickets themselves&mdash;and how will
they not be valued by the curious collectors of a
future day?&mdash;were elegantly engraven, and printed
on stout cards, measuring about five inches by eight:
they consisted of an oblong elevation of the New
Bridge, looking down the River, ‘<em>Perkins</em>, <em>St. Mary
Axe</em>, <em>Sculpsit</em>,’ having beneath it the following words:</p>

<p>These, however, admitted only to the galleries of
the Coffer-Dam, the lowest floor being reserved for
the bearers of a second Ticket, printed in letter-press,
on a pale pink card, of an ordinary size, and containing
the following words.</p>

</p>

<div>
<p>“The general passage was along the outer gallery,
but the latter admissions were conducted down a
staircase, lined with crimson, opposite to the principal
entrance. Both these Tickets, however, were required
to be <em>shewn</em> only, being intended for preservation as
memorials, and they were admitted at each end of the
Bridge. Having passed the barriers, the visitors proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
to the <span class="smcap">Grand Entrance to the Coffer-Dam</span>,</p>

<p class="pc">which was formed by removing part of the stone
parapet of the Bridge, adjoining the fourth recess
from the Southwark end, on the Western side; the
break being most expeditiously made just as the
Bridge was cleared. It was then that the extreme
elegance of this entrance became perfectly visible.
Several steps, covered with crimson cloth, led up to a
kind of tent formed of flags, gathered in festoons,
with roses of the same, and surmounted by a white
flag bearing a red cross, and having the Union in the
first quarter, the Sword of St. Paul in the second,
and the Saltire of Southwark in the fourth. The
roof of this entrance was also formed of two immense
red ensigns, charged with the Union in their quarters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
the sides were elegantly divided into arches, richly
festooned and entwined with flags; and, on the left-hand
of the entrance, at the edge of the pavement,
was erected a board, which stated, that ‘All
Carriages, not in the Procession, are, on setting down
the company, to pass on into Southwark, and return
from Southwark to take up.’ Round the whole of the
Dam itself was a broad stage; which formed a most
delightful promenade, secured from the heat of the
sun by the tent above, whilst the air, light, and prospect,
might be enjoyed through the Arches. <span class="smcap">The

<p class="pc">terminated in a circular form, and presented a peculiarly
beautiful object from the water; whence a series

<p class="pc">formed, however, its most magnificent prospect; especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
when seen from a point of sufficient elevation
to comprise the whole extent of its splendid and capacious
amphitheatre. The nearest objects were the
thick and irregular walls of discoloured piles standing
in the water, from which all boats were kept off by
persons stationed for the purpose; and on the interior
row was the outer gallery of the tent, with its decorated
arches. The awning above was raised on a
little forest of scaffold-poles, which would have appeared
of unusual strength any where but by the
side of the huge blocks of timber immediately
beneath them: and, over the whole, the breeze unfolded
to the sun the several banners. In the centre
waved the Royal Standard of England; at the Western
top of the tent was the flag of the Navy Board;
at the opposite point that of the Admiralty; and
above these a rope extended the whole length of the
building, decorated with about five-and-twenty signal-colours,
furnished, like all the others, from the Royal
Dock-Yard at Woolwich.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>“This erection was divided into four principal
parts, consisting of a floor and three galleries, the
whole being capable of containing 2000 persons;
nearly which number was probably present. The
floor was laid 45 feet below high-water mark, and
measured 95 feet by 36, being formed of four-inch
beechen planks, resting upon Piles headed with iron;
upon which was a layer of timber two feet thick, and
a course of brick-work and stone, each of 2&frac12; feet
deep. It was surrounded by three rows of seats, excepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
at the entrance at the Eastern end; and on the
North side was a chair of state, covered with crimson
cloth, having behind it the seats appropriated to the
Lord Mayor’s family and private friends. The whole
floor was capable of receiving 500 persons, and was
entirely covered with red baize, excepting at a rectangular
space in the centre, within which appeared
a cavity, cut in stone, of 21 inches by 15, and 7 in
depth, for the coins, &amp;c., over which the First
Stone was suspended by a strong fall and tackle, secured
to the upright timbers of the Dam. Above the
floor was a gallery, containing three rows of covered
seats, sufficient to hold 400 spectators; and over it
were two others; the lower one, of two rows for 400;
and the upper tier for 300 more. Three other galleries
also stretched along the cross beams above;
whilst a still more lofty one, at the Western end, was
appropriated to the Ward Schools of Bridge, Dowgate,
and Candlewick. The general character of the Dam
was strength and solidity; the tiers of seats being
supported by massive cross-beams, wreathed and decorated
with flags and rosettes; along the centre passed
another very thick timber, bearing the uprights and
their respective supporters; and from the roof several
large flags hung heavily downwards. The taste and
ingenuity which were exerted in the arrangements,
had indeed left nothing to be wished for; whilst the
general security was everywhere so palpably apparent,
as to dispel the apprehensions even of the most timid.
Such was the appearance of the <span class="smcap">Interior of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
Coffer-Dam, and the position of the first stone</span>,</p>

<p class="pc">which was of the best hard Aberdeen Granite, weighing
4 tons. Its measurement was, 5 feet <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch
long, 3 feet 6<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches broad, and 2 feet 10 inches deep;
containing 50 feet 7 inches in cubic measure; and its
situation as nearly as possible the centre of the
First, or South Pier, on the Southwark side. The
Company continued rapidly to arrive until the barriers
were closed at 2 o’clock, when most of the seats in the
Coffer-Dam were occupied; and where, to lighten as
much as possible the interval of waiting, the bands of
the Horse-Guards, Red and Blue, and of the Artillery
Company, which were stationed in a gallery at the entrance,
were employed to furnish frequent entertainment:
Refreshments of Tea, Coffee, Champagne,
&amp;c., being also liberally supplied by the Committee.
About a quarter before three o’clock, the Lady Mayoress,
and her family, came to the Dam in the private
state-carriage; and at four, a signal-gun announced
that the Procession had left the Court-yard of
Guildhall, nearly in the following order; passing
through Cheapside, Cornhill, and Grace-Church
Street, to the Bridge, where it was received by the
Committee, and other members of the Common Council;
the principal persons being in their own carriages.</p>

<p>“The streets through which the Procession passed,
were all thronged; every window was filled with
spectators; and, on arriving at its destination, the River,
the Wharfs, the most distant buildings, and even
Southwark Bridge, were equally crowded with thousands
of impatient gazers. It was not, however, until
a quarter before five, that the field-pieces of the Artillery
Company, at the old Swan Stairs’ Wharf, announced
the cavalcade’s actual approach, when the
bands played the famous Y&auml;ger Chor of Weber’s
‘<cite>Freyschutz</cite>.’ The City-Watermen, bearing their
richly emblazoned standards, soon afterwards entered
the Coffer-Dam, when, after the colours had been
very ingeniously passed between the timbers, and
grouped around the Stone, it being found that they
would materially obstruct the view, they were, with
similar difficulty, conveyed back again. The narrow
and winding passages of the Dam destroyed much of
the stately order of the Procession; but nearly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
whole Court of Aldermen, and a large party of the
Common-Council, in their scarlet and purple gowns,
having appeared on the floor beneath, they were followed
by the City Officers; the Lord Mayor, in his robes of
state; and His Royal Highness the Duke of York, in
a plain blue coat, wearing the Garter round his knee,
and the star of the order upon his breast. In the same
part of the Procession also came the Earl of Darnley;
Lord James Stuart; the Right Hon. C. W. W. Wynn,
President of the Board of Controul; Admiral Sir
George Cockburn, M. P.; Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin,
Bart, M. P.; Sir George Warrender, Bart, M. P.;
Sir Peter Laurie; Sir Robert Wilson, M. P.; Thomas
Wilson, Esq., M. P.; William Williams, Esq., M. P.;
George Holme Sumner, Esq., M. P.; and several other
personages of distinction.</p>

<p>“The Lord Mayor and His Royal Highness having
arrived at the state chair, amidst the waving of handkerchiefs,
and the loudest cheers, and having both of
them declined that seat of honour, they remained
standing during the whole of the ceremony; which
then commenced by the Ward Schools and the visitors
singing ‘<cite>God save the King</cite>,’ verse and chorus, in
which the Duke also joined with great enthusiasm.
The Lord Mayor then removed towards the Eastern
end of the Platform, in the centre of the Coffer-Dam
floor, where there was a small stage covered with
crimson cloth, attended by four members of the Bridge
Committee, bearing the bottle for the coins, an inscription
incrustated in glass, the level, and the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>

Clark, Esq., the venerable Chamberlain of London,
next produced a white satin purse, containing a series

border, were presented to each person on entering
the Dam; as was also another edition of the
Latin, engraven on copper, of the same size as the
admission-ticket, and having the same view of the New
Bridge above it. The brass plate was then placed
upon the glass pillars, when Mr. Richard Lambert
Jones, Sub-Chairman of the Committee for erecting
the edifice, presented the splendid Trowel to the Lord
Mayor, with this address: ‘My Lord, I have the honour
to inform your Lordship, that the Committee of
Management has appointed you, in your character of
Lord Mayor of London, to lay the First Stone of the
New London Bridge; and that I am directed to present
your Lordship with this Trowel, as a means of
assistance to your Lordship in accomplishing that
object.’ Upon which the Lord Mayor turned towards
the Duke of York, and thus addressed His Royal
Highness, and the other witnesses of the ceremony.</p>

<p>“‘Though it is not essential for me to speak at
any length upon the purpose for which we are this
day assembled, since its importance to this great commercial
City must be clearly evident; yet I cannot
refrain from offering a few observations, feeling, as I
do, more than an ordinary interest in the accomplishment
of the undertaking, of which the present ceremony
is only the primary step. I cannot consider the
present a favourable moment for entering into any
chronological history of the present venerable Bridge,
which is now, from the increased commerce of the
country, and the rapid strides made by the Sciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
in this Kingdom, found inadequate to its purposes;
but would rather advert to the many advantages which
must naturally result from the completion of this
great national enterprise. Whether there be taken
into consideration the rapid, and consequently dangerous,
currents arising from the obstruction incidental
to the defects of this ancient edifice, which have proved
so destructive to human life and property, or its
difficult and incommodious approaches and acclivity,
it must be matter of sincere congratulation, that we
are living in times when the resources of this highly-favoured
country are competent to a work of such
great public utility. If ever there were a period
more suitable than another, for engaging in national
improvements, it must be the present; governed as
we are by a Sovereign, the munificent and accomplished
Patron of the Arts, beneath whose mild and paternal
sway, by the blessing of Divine Providence, we now
enjoy profound peace; living under a government, by
the enlightened policy of which, our trade and manufactures
so extensively flourish; and represented by
a Parliament, ever ready to foster, by the most liberal
grants, any plans for the improvement of the Empire;
to which the present undertaking is so deeply indebted
for its munificent support. Thus happily situated,
it is impossible to hail such advantages with
other feelings than those of gratitude and delight;
and it is to me a source of unqualified pride and pleasure,
that this great undertaking should have occurred
in the year when I have been honoured by the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
of Chief Magistrate of this great, this greatest, City,
not of England only, but of the world; and that
this important ceremony should take place in the
Ward which I have the honour to represent in the
Civic Councils. I cannot conclude without acknowledging
how highly complimentary I feel it to the
honourable office which I now fill, to meet such an
auditory as now surrounds me; in which I see the
illustrious Prince, Heir-presumptive to the Throne of
this Kingdom; many of His Majesty’s Ministers, and
the distinguished Nobles of the land; my active brother-magistrates;
my kind fellow-citizens; and, above
all, so brilliant an assemblage of that sex, whose radiant
smiles, this day, shed a lustre on our meeting.
Under such auspices, I rejoice to lay the Foundation-Stone
of a structure, which, I trust, will, through all
future time, prove an ornament to the Metropolis; reflect
credit on the Architect; and redound to the honour
of this Corporation: and I offer up a sincere
and fervent prayer, that, in executing this great work,
there may occur no calamity; that, in completing what
is most particularly intended as a preventive of future
danger, no mischief may overcloud the universal rejoicings
on the undertaking.’</p>

<p>“The very warm applauses which followed this
most appropriate address subsided only upon the
commencement of the Masonic ceremonies, by a portion
of fine mortar being placed around the cavity of
the Stone, by several of the Assistants, and spread by
the Lord Mayor with his splendid Trowel; after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
which, precisely at 5 o’clock, the First Stone was gradually
lowered into its bed by a brazen block of four
sheaves, and the power of a machine called a crab.
When it was settled, it was finally secured by several
Masons, who cut four sockets close to it on the stone
beneath, into which were fitted strong iron clamps,
cured with plaster of Paris. The Lord Mayor then
struck it with a mallet, and ascertained its accuracy by
applying the level to its East, North, West, and South
surfaces. The work being thus perfected, the City
Sword and Mace were disposed in Saltire upon the
stone; successive shouts burst from the numerous
spectators; the bands again played the National Anthem
of England; and a flag being lowered as a signal
on the top of the Dam, the guns of the Artillery
Company, and the carronades on Calvert’s Brewery
Wharf, fired a concluding salute. The declining
Sun, also, contributed to shed a golden glory upon the
closing ceremony; for, as the day advanced, its radiance
streamed through an opening in the tent-covering
above, and, gradually approaching the Stone, shone
upon it with a dazzling brilliancy, at the very moment
of its being deposited. The whole ceremonial terminated
with an universal repetition of ‘<cite>God save the
King</cite>,’ and three series of huzzas, for the Duke of
York, Old England, and Mr. Rennie; after which,
when the Procession had left the Dam, amidst similar
acclamations to those which first greeted it, many of
the visitors went down to the floor, to view the Stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
more closely, and to boast to posterity that they had
stood upon it, or walked over it.</p>

<p>“To conclude the festivities of the day with appropriate
Civic hospitality, the Lord Mayor, at his
own private expense, gave a most sumptuous banquet
to the Corporation, and his noble visitors, at the Mansion
House. The dinner and wines included Turtle,
Venison, Champagne, Claret, and every other luxury;
to which the following card of Invitation, thus commemorated
the event:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A Royal dinner at Carlton Palace, on the same
day, deprived him of the presence of the Duke of
York, who quitted the Bridge through Southwark,
immediately after the ceremony. His Lordship’s
guests, however, amounted to a greater number than
had ever before dined within the Mansion House, since,
in addition to upwards of 360 in the Egyptian Hall,
nearly 200 of the Artillery Company dined in the
Saloon; the whole edifice being brilliantly illuminated
with gas, both within and without, and the entertainment
superintended by a Committee of his Lordship’s
private friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span></p>

<p>“To mark the very deep public sense of the Lord
Mayor’s munificent conduct upon this memorable occasion,
at a Court of Common Council held on the
following day, Thursday, June 16th, Adam Oldham,
Esq., Deputy of the Ward of Farringdon Within, called
the attention of the Court to the very splendid
manner in which his Lordship had conducted himself
towards the Members of the Corporation, at the
recent ceremony of Laying the First Stone of the
New London Bridge; and suggested that the Court
should make some early and suitable acknowledgment
of his Lordship’s distinguished liberality. In consequence
of which, at a subsequent Court held on July
28th, a motion was made by R. L. Jones, Esq., ‘That
a Gold Medal be prepared, with a suitable Inscription,
commemorative of the circumstance of Laying the
First Stone of a New London Bridge, and presented
to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor in the name
of this Court:’ which was unanimously agreed to,

questioned, I shall give a short account of each of
them; at the same time, expressing my surprise, that

these classical memorials. The first private Medal

Inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc small p2 pb2 center">‘TO COMMEMORATE THE<br />
LAYING OF THE<br />
FIRST STONE OF LONDON BRIDGE<br />
BY<br />
THE RIGHT HON. JOHN GARRATT, LORD MAYOR,<br />
ON THE 15th OF JUNE 1825, IN THE PRESENCE OF<br />
H.R.H. THE DUKE OF YORK, VARIOUS BRANCHES<br />
OF THE NOBILITY, AND THE CORPORATION OF THE CITY,<br />
AND IN TESTIMONY OF HIS LORDSHIP’S<br />
PUBLIC WORTH AND PRIVATE VIRTUES,<br />
THIS MEDAL WAS DESIGNED<br />
AT THE REQUEST<br />
OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS,<br />
BY JOSEPH YORK HATTON.’

<p>“The other Medal had about twenty impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
struck in silver, which were distributed to the Engineers,
assistants, &amp;c., on the day of the foundation.
These were 2&frac12; inches in diameter, and nearly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an
inch in thickness. The obverse consisted of a fine
head of the elder Mr. Rennie, from a former Medal;
and the reverse contained a design, by Mr. William
Knight, of the New London Bridge Works, consisting
of an elevation of the edifice, with representations
of the First Stone, Mallet, and Trowel: the Inscription
being as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small pc pb2 p2 center">

<p>“Such are the few remaining reliques of this
Ceremony, which have been provided for posterity;
for, with the exception of a slight etching of the
Western end of the Coffer-Dam, in a Memorandum
Book, and an Indian Ink Drawing, by Dighton, of
some of the principal persons standing about the First
Stone, there is no other representation to record it.
There are, indeed, several prospects of the finished
Edifice; though of its exact features, it is probable
we can form no very correct idea, until we are a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
years older; so then let us here take our last
<span class="smcap">View of the New London Bridge</span>;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc">for such are all the particulars and memorials which
I can give you concerning this interesting Civic ceremony;
and if the Italian of old could give his famous
‘<span class="smcap">Esto Perpetua!</span>’ to his water-seated Venice, how
much rather shall every true-hearted citizen bestow it
upon this rising edifice, beneath whose expansive
arches,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The time shall come, when, free as seas or wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth’s distant ends our glories shall behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the new world launch forth to seek the old!’”</span>
</div></div>

<p class="pc">I concluded these lines of Pope’s “<cite>Windsor Forest</cite>”
with so much enthusiasm, that I did not immediately
remark the silence which followed; but upon looking
up to wish my auditor a good night, how greatly was
I astonished to find myself alone! with only a few
dim lights in the empty coffee-room, and the waiter
sleeping in a distant box. Hastily starting from my
seat, I inquired what had become of Mr. Postern,
when, to my great surprise, he absolutely denied that
he had seen him either come in or go out. Since that
time, too, I have everywhere, but in vain, sought
“the learned Pundit” who had so long conferred with
me. I certainly cannot discredit the evidence of my
own senses, but, upon reconsidering all the circumstances,
it appears to me that I must have seen and
conversed with the shade of Peter of Colechurch, the
original Architect of London Bridge! Our narrative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
however, rests upon more solid foundations; for, as
I have verified every authority referred to, these
<span class="smcap">Chronicles</span> are presented to posterity as the collected
memorials of that once-famous edifice, which within
a few years will exist no longer.”</p>

<p>From the extreme delicacy of the aquatint Engravings of
this Work, a limited number of Impressions only can be taken
from them.</p>

<p class="blockquot small">“This is a work, which bids fair not merely to establish the fame of Capt. Grindlay,
but to do honour to the British arts; and if it meets with but small encouragement,
we shall think it disreputable to the public taste, the improvement
of which has, tardily, become an object of some solicitude to the state.”&mdash;<cite>Asiatic
Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="blockquot small">“In our number for June last, we introduced to our readers, by a brief notice,
the first part of the beautiful Work issued to the world under the above title.
In the design and execution of that, we perceived sufficient excellence to justify
our predicting its complete success: and we are gratified to find, that high as our
expectations of general approbation for this undertaking undoubtedly were, they
have been realized to their utmost extent.”&mdash;<cite>Oriental Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="blockquot small">“The fidelity of the representations, in the portion now under our eye, is very
striking; and all the plates are most acceptable, as illustrating an extremely interesting
and important country, hitherto little known either by literary or graphic
means. The variety of these views, and the handsome style in which they are
executed, will, together with the appropriate literary descriptions, recommend
this publication not only to persons connected with India, but to the British
public generally, and collectors in the arts.”&mdash;<cite>Literary Gazette.</cite></p>

giving a faithful Account of his Voyages, Shipwreck, and
Travels, from his first outset as a Midshipman in the E. I.

<p class="blockquot small">“The Author, so far as we can collect from his Book, appears to be endowed
with a highly sensitive temperament, and with talents of no mean order. We
have been pleased with the style of his narrative, for its natural fluency and
grace, warmed as it is throughout with a spirit of romance, which makes its way
readily to the Heart.”&mdash;<em>Monthly Review, July, 1827.</em></p>
